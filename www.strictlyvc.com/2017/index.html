<h2>How to Build a Brand in 2017: Tips from Glossier&#8217;s Emily Weiss</h2>
<p>There’s no shortage of women’s beauty brands, yet for many millennial women in particular, one young outfit — the cosmetics company <a href="http://glossier.com/">Glossier </a> — seems to stand out. Having products that customers like is undoubtedly one large reason why. The company’s “boy brow,” a kind of mascara meant to thicken and tame eyebrows, is particularly popular. But Glossier has also found a way to establish a kind of cult following because of the numerous ways it keeps communication channels to its consumers wide open.</p>
<p>At a <a href="https://strictlyvcinsiderseries6.splashthat.com/">StrictlyVC event</a> in San Francisco last week, Glossier’s founder, Emily Weiss, talked about focusing on ways to engage customers that more traditional brands have neglected. Weiss, a former beauty editor who launched Glossier several years after creating Into the Gloss — a site about women’s grooming routines that now attracts 1.5 million unique visitors monthly — also talked about the role of content in growing her business.</p>
<p>You can catch part of that talk by clicking through to TechCrunch below. Her interviewer is venture capitalist Eric Liaw of IVP, which recently wrote led Glossier’s $24 million Series B round. In the meantime, here are some other interesting — and instructive — outtakes from that conversation.</p>
<p><strong>On why Weiss launched Glossier in 2013, after creating Into the Gloss out of her apartment in 2010:</strong></p>
<p>Here, Weiss talked about the many influential people she’d come to interview for Into the Gloss, including J.Crew’s creative director Jenna Lyons, serial entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, and professional celebrity Kim Kardashian. “I’d be sitting on their bathroom floors and squeezing tubes of creams and … discussing the big wide world of beauty, and I realized there was a disconnect” between the leading beauty conglomerates and their customers, said Weiss. Though many women seemed to have an affinity for certain products, they didn’t necessarily know anything about those brands’ values or communicate with them in any way. Weiss spied an opportunity to rectify that by “building a company around what women want, not just from a product perspective but from an engagement perspective, from a distribution perspective, and from a values perspective.”</p>
<p><strong>Could she have built Glossier if Into the Gloss hadn’t attracted a following first? Could she have launched the two in reverse order?</strong></p>
<p>As a “content-first” company, it’s a question that Weiss receives a lot, evidently. But she doesn’t see the two businesses — the blog and the cosmetics line — as distinct. “Sure,” she’d said, “we could be a like a lot of consumer brands that start blogs after they start their business. But in our case, I think Glossier is still very much a content company. I think about our products themselves as pieces of content.” How, exactly? Because many of its customers purchase its products, photograph them, then upload them to social media — often knowing Glossier will re-post them to its own accounts. In fact, she likened Glossier’s products to “crayons” for its customers.</p>
<p><strong>On how the brand has stayed &#8220;authentic&#8221; versus become seen as more commercial:</strong></p>
<p>Weiss noted that in 2017, not only is the customer always right, but thanks to social media — whether it’s a product review on Amazon or an Instagram post, that customer “has a microphone and she’s reaching 50, 500, 5,000 or 500,000 of her nearest and dearest friends and is able to talk about her preferences.”</p>
<p>To ensure she is saying only positive things about Glossier, the company focuses, of course, on maintaining product quality. “Ultimately we’re making and selling a consumer good that needs to work and that need to make customers happy.”</p>
<p>But the company is also very focused on transparency and “voice,” Weiss explained. “We like to think that whenever we talk to [our customer] through captions on Instagram or through email or through copy on the site, that we’re writing text messages to a friend.” For Glossier, “staying true to that voice has created a lot of loyalty and trust with our customer,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Other reasons that Glossier has struck a chord with its customer base:</strong></p>
<p>One point we found particularly interesting during Weiss’s talk was about Glossier’s willingness to acknowledge and support other brands.</p>

<h2>Top News in the A.M.</h2>
<p><strong>Snap</strong>, parent of messaging service Snapchat, has set the price range for its IPO and it&#8217;s seeking a a valuation of between $16.20 billion and $18.52 billion. That&#8217;s roughly 10 percent below expectations, which has industry observers wondering about its motivations. Either way, it gives the company the richest valuation in a U.S. tech IPO since Alibaba (and, before that, Facebook). Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-ipo-valuation-idUSKBN15V0JK">more here</a>.</p>
<h2>Atomico Just Closed on $765 Million, Its Biggest Fund Yet</h2>
<p><a href="http://atomico.com/">Atomico</a> has closed its fourth fund with $765 million, making it one of Europe’s single largest venture capital funds.</p>
<p>The firm began raising the fund eleven months ago (we’d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/18/atomico-is-raising-a-750m-fourth-fund/">flagged it for you</a> after searching the SEC filings). And while it represents a sizable step up from Atomico’s third fund, which closed with <a href="http://www.strictlyvc.com/2013/11/09/atomico-raises-476-6-million-third-fund/">$476.6 million</a> in 2013, its pace of fundraising highlights a major difference between Europe and the U.S., where LPs often feel pressured into committing quickly to top funds.</p>
<p>Investors had plenty of reason to be excited about Atomico. Its current stakes include Finnish game maker <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rovio-strives-to-create-next-hit-beyond-angry-birds-1472827593">Rovio</a>, as well as the “unicorn” payments company <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/11/07/buy-now-pay-later/#477704416870">Klarna</a> and the travel site <a href="http://www.goeuro.com/">GoEuro</a>. It also saw huge wins when Climate Corp. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-02/monsanto-buys-climate-corporation-for-930-million-bringing-big-data-to-the-farm">sold</a> to Monsanto for roughly $1 billion in 2013 and again last year when early portfolio company Supercell sold a majority stake in its business to China’s Tencent for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-agrees-to-acquire-clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-1466493612">$8.6 billion</a>.</p>
<p>But general partner Mattias Ljungman notes that the U.S. has a “much longer tradition” of investing in venture capital firms. Meanwhile, institutions in Europe are “sort of now starting to look at it. If you compare it with private equity [where investors tend to buy and sell entire companies], that also took time in Europe.” He says. “But once investors started to understand it, the amount of capital they began deploying became significant and even <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/dig.v33.n1.1202">outpaced</a> what we saw in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Atomico thinks European venture capital could reach the same kind of breakout velocity at some point. In the meantime, the firm — originally founded by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennstrom — is now one of the best-funded firms in Europe, with its central office in London but people on the ground in Beijing, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York and Stockholm (where Ljungman happened to be when we spoke).</p>
<p>Atomico also now offers some of the most extensive services to its portfolio companies, it likes to note.</p>

<h2>More Capital for L.A., as Fika Ventures Closes Its Debut Fund</h2>
<p>Investors are seemingly growing more excited about L.A. by the day. The newest sign comes via a $40 million fund that L.A.-based <a href="http://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> is announcing today.</p>
<p>That’s none too shabby for a venture firm that was founded just last year.</p>
<p>Fika was created by TX Zhuo, formerly a managing partner at <a href="http://karlinvc.com/">Karlin Ventures</a>, and Eva Ho, a former general partner and cofounder of San Francisco-based <a href="http://susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a> who decided not to participate in that firm’s second, $<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/16/susa-ventures-closes-50-million-fund-to-back-more-seed-stage-startups/">50 million</a> seed-stage fund — a split that Ho characterizes as “highly amicable. I left because I wanted to focus more on L.A-based investments, as well as be part of a smaller partnership. (Ho had three other partners at Susa.)</p>
<p>The two met in 2011, when Zhuo left a job as an associate with a <a href="http://www.innovationendeavors.com/">Palo Alto outfit</a> and headed to L.A. to launch Karlin, which is an affiliate of a much larger investment firm called Karlin Asset Management. He and Ho wound up working on several local events together, as well as collaborating and co-leading several days; over time, they realized they had complementary networks and like investing in similar things.</p>
<p>Ho declines to take credit for any deals at Susa, saying it “applied a team-approach across all deals,” but she says she was involved in supporting companies that include <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>, a startup currently building a network of top tier computer science education programs across the African continent (it has gone on to raise $41 million to date, including from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative); <a href="https://www.modsy.com/">Modsy</a>, a startup bringing virtual reality to home design (it has raised roughly $10 million, including from Norwest Venture Partners); and <a href="https://www.flexport.com/">Flexport</a>, a freight logistics company that wants to be the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-11/flexport-wants-to-be-uber-of-the-oceans">Uber of the oceans</a> and has so far raised at least $94 million toward that end.</p>
<p>Zhou’s most notable deals meanwhile include the interior design marketplace <a href="https://www.laurelandwolf.com/">Laurel &amp; Wolf</a> (it has raised more than $25 million, including from Benchmark) and <a href="https://www.policygenius.com/">PolicyGenius</a>, an online insurance platform that has raised roughly $21 million, including from  Revolution.</p>
<p>Zhou and Ho says the fund took about six months to raise, including from some funds of funds, family offices, VCs, CEOs and founders — including 15 from their past portfolios. They also attracted institutional investors Cross Creek Advisors and Knollwood Investment Advisory.</p>

<h2>This VC Firm Just Produced One of the First Detailed Equity Reports About Snap</h2>
<p>Many things that used to be true primarily of the public market now happen within the world of private company investing, including the participation of mutual fund investors.</p>
<p>Now, you can add equity research reports to that list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goodwatercap.com/">Goodwater Capital</a> — a two-year-old, consumer-tech-focused venture firm is today taking the wraps off a <a href="http://www.goodwatercap.com/thesis/understanding-snapchat/">detailed snapshot</a> of pre-IPO Snap, parent of the disappearing-message app Snapchat. In doing so, the San Mateo, Ca., firm hopes to differentiate itself from its venture peers while also seizing on an underserved opportunity: producing research that helps Wall Street understand tech companies — before their own banking analysts do the job.</p>
<p>It’s a role that has largely been left to the media, which has been dutifully poring over Snap’s roughly 200-page <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm">S-1</a> since it was made public on February 2. Many reporters have done an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-03/snap-s-concentrated-power-structure-takes-a-page-from-old-media">excellent</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-facebook-wall-street-sizes-up-snaps-ipo-1486920692">job</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snap-letter/">too</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it’s nice to be able to review slightly more comprehensive, particularly if you missed a lot of the coverage that emerged in the days after Snap’s S-1 was first spied in the SEC’s giant electronic filing bin. It’s particularly worth examining if you’re not a Snap aficionado and want to become one quickly, given that the company’s roadshow could reportedly begin this coming Friday.</p>
<p>Goodwater’s report was overseen by Eric Kim, a former investor with <a href="https://www.maverickcap.com/">Maverick Capital</a>, who launched the consumer-tech focused firm with his former Stanford MBA classmate (and former <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/">Kleiner Perkins</a> partner) Chi-Hua Chien in 2014.</p>
<p>Kim, who previously worked on numerous high-profile deals for Maverick like the the multi-platform texting app <a href="http://www.kakao.com/main">KakaoTalk</a> and the e-commerce platform <a href="http://www.coupang-usa.com/">Coupang</a>, clearly took the task seriously, too. In addition to its own analysis, Goodwater last month surveyed 2,076 participants who were evenly distributed across geography, age, and income, to produce some of its findings.</p>
<p>Says Kim of what motivated him, “I saw KakaoTalk evolve from a 15-person company into a very valuable public company and there was suddenly this huge gap to bridge, with Wall Street looking at very different metrics than we were accustomed to discussing. Our [Goodwater] report [on Snap] aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the company that both Silicon Valley and Wall Street can understand.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Kim says he doesn’t think people (i.e., reporters) are looking at the company in the same way that Wall Street is liable to evaluate it. For example, Kim notes that plenty of editorials have compared <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-03/snapchat-s-performance-doesn-t-match-ipo-hype">Snapchat with Instagram</a>, but he asserts that even more than Instagram owner Facebook, Snap is “trying to take on the entertainment world and replace TV.”</p>
<p>In other words, a better comparison for Snapchat are entertainment companies.</p>

<h2>Bradley Tusk on His Fast Rise in Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>Bradley Tusk has long been known in political circles. He was once deputy governor of Illinois, working for the now-incarcerated former governor Rod Blagojevich. He also worked for Michael Bloomberg during one of his tenures as mayor of New York City and in 2009 ran Bloomberg’s successful, third re-election campaign.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to a generous bonus check from Bloomberg, Tusk was able to launch a <a href="http://tuskstrategies.com/">consultancy</a> in 2010 that helps Fortune 500 companies launch political-style campaigns to achieve a particular end. A year later, in another stroke of luck, Tusk became the first outside consultant to Uber and accepted his pay in equity. Since then, through a <a href="http://tuskventures.com/">separate outfit</a> that <em>only</em> accepts its payment in equity,  Tusk has become a go-to source both Silicon Valley VCs and startup founders needing help in persuading regulators to let them have their way. (Among its other 23 clients: <a href="https://www.eaze.com/">Eaze</a>, <a href="https://www.altschool.com/">AltSchool</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, and <a href="https://www.handy.com/">Handy</a>.)</p>
<p>At a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145636603@N06/sets/72157676627652993/">StrictlyVC event</a> last week, Tusk talked about his work in Silicon Valley, whether he is interested (as sometimes rumored) in running for office himself, and what certain startups can expect from the Trump administration. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity; you can watch the broader interview if you click on the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Why go into business for yourself after the Bloomberg campaign?</strong></p>
<p>I knew that the skill set that I had was really devising and running campaigns, and because my work had taken me all over the country, I knew I could do it in lots of places. And those two things were a little different from what anyone else in that market was doing.</p>
<p>And Mike is a generous man, and he gave me a bonus at the end of the campaign, and I took a look at the amount left after taxes – it was all the money I had — and I looked at my wife and was like, “When this gets down to $50,000, I’ve got to go get a job.” And luckily it didn’t come to [that].</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn from Bloomberg that you’re replicating?</strong></p>
<p>The [most important] thing for Mike is his culture. So our business in some ways is a microcosm of Bloomberg, where we’re all in a bullpen and [operate in a] very flat hierarchy with total transparency and we try to treat people really well and pay them really well, and we assume that we’re going to get great talent and it’s going to pay off. If you look at almost all of his businesses, and as mayor, his real skill set is that he attracts [talented people], he knows how to recruit them, how to support them, and how to give them the confidence they need to take risks.</p>
<p><strong>There are <a href="http://www.globalstrategygroup.com/">other</a> political strategy firms working with tech companies, but Tusk Ventures is the only one that everyone knows of because you’re so high profile. Why not operate behind the scenes? </strong></p>
<p>[T]he deal flow is the lifeblood of any VC, and that’s true for us, too. And in some ways, because I didn’t come up through this world at all, there had to be a way to say “Hey, here’s who we are, here’s what we do. If you have a really interesting company with a really big problem, we’re willing to take it on and we’re willing to do it for equity and be part of your team.” But it took being out there enough for people to realize it.</p>
<p><strong>Are other political strategists starting to emulate your approach?</strong></p>
<p>I hope not. It’s a challenge in a sense that first, we’re able to do all of it for equity — though I pay my people in real dollars — so there’s a lot of financial risk that you have to be willing to take and I’m able to do that. Also, typically, if you’re someone like me and you’re five years into your political consulting firm, you sell it to one of these big holding companies like WPP or Omnicom. And they’d never let you do something like this. So I’d like to think there are some barriers to entry to replicating our model, but I’m sure someone else can come in and do it, too.</p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in running for public office?</strong></p>
<p>No, I mean, the only job to me that’s worth having is being mayor of New York City. It’s a great job. I did launch a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/encounter-bradley-tusk-de-blasio.html">super-PAC</a> about a year ago to get rid of our current mayor, Bill de Blasio, just because I think we deserve better than a mayor who’s under seven separate federal corruption investigations and who comes to work at 11 a.m and doesn’t work on Fridays and doesn’t care about substance. But that’s different than saying I want the job. Also, I’m an independent – another thing I got from Mike Bloomberg. And kind of like in San Francisco, in New York City, if you aren’t a Democrat, it’s exceptionally hard to win.</p>

<h3>Carl Bass on His Surprising Resignation from Autodesk &#8212; and What&#8217;s Next</h3>
<p>Carl Bass is sitting at his desk at Autodesk today, but he’s no longer CEO of the publicly traded design software company. He stepped down earlier this week in a move that some associated — wrongly, notes Bass — with an <a href="https://pando.com/2017/02/06/autodesk-ceo-carl-bass-ive-been-batshit-about-trump-year-hes-acting-somewhere-between-dictator-and-small-business-owner/245af5a7f062b0f5f4427a3f338e1b601020ff58/">interview</a> Bass granted to the outlet Pando, wherein he disparaged President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This morning, we talked with Bass about his resignation, his continuing role as a board member with Autodesk, if he regrets speaking out against the administration as a public company CEO, and whether he thinks more tech CEOs should do the same. The famously straight-shooting Bass had plenty to say about all. He also shared some of what he hopes to work on next. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>You stepped down as CEO on Tuesday, and senior VPs Amar Hanspal and Andrew Anagnost have been installed as interim co-CEOs. But you’re helping in the search for your replacement, is that correct? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, Tuesday was my last day, but I’ll continue working as an employee for three months and am continuing on the board of directors for a while. We started planning this a while ago, because the best way to do [a succession change] is for the current CEO to step down. Otherwise, the best external candidates aren’t sure there’s really a job opening.  You know, sometimes you see the pocket veto, where the CEO has a change of heart and says, “Hey, if you’re going to choose so and so, I’m not leaving.” This is a clean break, and outside candidates take it seriously, and the board takes it seriously. We’ve hired an outside search team who will be talking with both internal and external candidates, so hopefully [we’ll find the right candidate] quickly.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve said that you and Autodesk’s board began succession planning talks 18 months ago, but some people believe an interview wherein you criticized Donald Trump played a role in the timing of your resignation.</strong></p>
<p>There were a lot of rumors this week that couldn’t be further from the truth. To the extent that you take what a company says with a grain of salt [because companies can be so promotional], when it comes to governance, these are real rules. There are real penalties of law. Public companies don’t take that lightly.</p>
<p><strong>Do you at all regret being so public about how you feel about Trump? </strong></p>
<p>Not, not at all. Not one bit. When you look at Trump, there are three things going on: policies; character and temperament; and executive or administrative functioning. I think on two and three, almost everybody can agree that he’s not qualified, and that’s why I joked [to Pando’s Sarah Lacy] that he’s running the government like someone in between a small businessman and dictator. I watch what’s happening every day, and I’m reminded of my kids when they were four years old and had no awareness of anything outside of themselves. He’s a 70-year-old baby.</p>
<p>On the policy stuff, it’s hard to parse what his is policy is. We’re against the “One China” policy; now we’re for it. We’re going to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jersusalem; now we’re not. Policy seems to be the part of the job that least interests him. These are complicated issues, but they don’t seem to captivate him. He doesn’t seem particularly curious or thoughtful about them. He’s more interested in tweeting out the latest insult that [springs to mind].</p>
<p><strong>Do you think other tech executives should be more vocal, or is too much of a risk?</strong></p>
<p>I think anybody who has a platform should speak out. I’ve had a ton of people reach out to me this week — people much better-known than I am, saying, “That’s awesome, what you said.” And I’m like, “Why don’t <em>you</em> say it? You have a bigger pulpit.”</p>
<p><strong>A lot of people think Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk should step off Trump’s economic advisory council. What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a complicated issue for Elon. I think many of the things he’s trying to accomplish are really worthy goals but they intersect with regulation: automomuos vehicles, putting things in space. You can’t do that without the government, so from very self-interested point of view, and in the interest of his companies, I understand. On the other hand, he has a very pubic platform and I’m sure he has an opinion and if everybody takes the self-interested view, the world doesn’t get to hear the opinions of its leaders. So I think it’s important but I certainly understand.</p>
<p>I’ve [feel even more strongly about Facebook COO] Sheryl Sandberg. She has gone out of her way to build a brand around the power of women and what they’re capable of, and when it comes to the Women’s March, she was invisible. She seems to have leaned out quite a bit.</p>

					<p>Happy Thursday, everyone!</p>
<p>Thanks very much to those of you who made it to our StrictlyVC event last night. We had <em>so</em> much fun, and the speakers &#8212; all of them &#8212; were outstanding. Giant thanks again to <strong>Aileen Lee</strong>, <strong>Amy Chang</strong>, <strong>Brad Feld</strong>, <strong>Emily Weiss</strong>, <strong>Bradley Tusk</strong>, <strong>Vivek Ramaswamy</strong>, <strong>Semil Shah</strong>, and <strong>Eric Liaw</strong> for making the time for readers.

<p>Also! Save the date: We&#8217;re hosting our next SVC event Thursday, <strong>May 4</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, also! We hope to see some of you at the <a href="http://saastrannual.com/">SaaStr conference</a> in a short while; we&#8217;ll be talking with <strong>Naval Ravikant</strong> of AngelList around 1:30. (We need to prep, which is why you&#8217;re receiving a short newsletter today.)</p>
<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong> revealed its fourth quarter earnings earlier today. The big takeaway: its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/twitters-streamlining-efforts-still-arent-fixing-its-core-business-problems/">ad business is stalling</a>.</p>
<h3>What Software Engineers Around the World are Being Paid</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-salaries-2017">new study</a> published by the data science team at Hired, a jobs marketplace for tech workers, shows why it&#8217;s becoming harder for software engineers to afford life in San Francisco, even while they make more money than their peers elsewhere in the U.S. and the world.</p>
<p>Based on 28,000 interview requests and job offers provided by more than 5,000 companies to 45,000 job seekers on Hired&#8217;s platform, the company&#8217;s data team has determined that the average salary for a software engineer in the Bay Area is $134,000. That&#8217;s more than software engineers anywhere in the country, through Seattle trails closely behind, paying engineers an average of $126,000. In other tech hubs, including Boston, Austin, L.A., New York, and Washington, D.C., software engineers are paid on average between $110,000 and $120,000.</p>
<p>Higher salaries don&#8217;t mean much with jaw-dropping rents and other soaring expenses associated with life in &#8220;Silicon Valley,&#8221; and San Francisco more specifically. Indeed, factoring in the cost of living, San Francisco is now one of the lowest-paying cities for software engineers, according to Hired&#8217;s lead data scientist, Jessica Kirkpatrick. According to her analysis, the $110,000 that an Austin engineer makes is the rough equivalent of being paid $198,000 in the Bay Area, considering how much further each dollar goes in the sprawling capital of Texas. The same is true of Melbourne, Australia, where software engineers are paid a comparatively low $107,000 on average, but who are making the equivalent of $150,000 in San Francisco.</p>

Bass, who will be replaced by interim co-CEOs and will remain on the company&#8217;s board, has reportedly been planning out his departure for the last 18 months. But news of his resignation also comes a day after the outlet Pando published an interview in which Bass spoke openly of his disdain for Donald Trump. &#8220;My concern is all on the personality side, the kookiness of the way [Trump is] operating, and the people he has surrounded himself with,&#8221; said Bass of the new administration. &#8220;Imagine we had a left-wing President, and he decided to appoint Arianna Huffington as the person to preside over the National Security Council. [And] what do you say or do to someone who is going to have a tantrum about whether a crowd size was bigger?

<h3>A Debit Card for Kids That Parents Manage from their Phones</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.greenlightcard.com/">Greenlight</a>, a three-year-old, Atlanta, Ga.-based startup, is trying to solve a problem that any parent of an elementary or junior high school student can well understand: how to give kids money without worrying that they’ll lose it or spend it on something they shouldn’t.</p>
<p>It isn’t the first reloadable, prepaid card. MasterCard, Visa and American Express each offer parent-friendly debit cards, among other outfits. But Greenlight — backed with seed funding from its executive team and a startup incubator at Georgia Tech called the <a href="http://atdc.org/">Advanced Technology Development Center</a> — is hoping to take on these giants by adding every imaginable bell and whistle to its FDIC-insured offering, as well as making its pricing affordable and straightforward.</p>
<p>Because we have a seven- and nine-year-old — both of whom reliably lose whatever money we give them for field trips and the like — we were curious to learn more. Co-founder Johnson Cook answered some of our questions last week.</p>
<p><strong>Greenlight is a nice idea, but it has plenty of competition. How does what you’re offering differ from what’s out there already?</strong></p>
<p>[We think] Greenlight is the first card with store-level controls — in other words, the ability for a parent to give a child a specific amount that he or she can spend at a specific store or website — like Starbucks, Chick-fil- A, the neighborhood market store, Amazon.com. We found that the ability to choose the specific stores where their kids can shop really resonated with parents.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the card’s other features?</strong></p>
<p>Parents can automate allowances very easily in the app. We’re also rolling out a Greenlight Savings account and Greenlight Giving, which will give parents and their kids a full view of their finances across spending, savings and giving. We’re very focused on empowering parents to raise their kids to be financially smart: to learn to spend wisely, the importance of saving so they can cover unexpected expenses, how to build wealth through investing, and the importance of credit.</p>
<p><strong>What about notifications? I’d think these would be pretty important to parents.</strong></p>
<p>Parents are instantly alerted any time the card is used, letting them know how much was spent and where. And notifications are customizable for both parents and their kids. You can receive notifications for when purchases are made, transactions are declined, the child makes a new request, low balances, funds transfers, for when the card is turned on or off, and messages received.</p>
<p><strong>You charge $4.99 per family per month for up to five kids. How did you settle on that particular price point, and why do a monthly fee versus take some percentage from each transaction?</strong></p>
