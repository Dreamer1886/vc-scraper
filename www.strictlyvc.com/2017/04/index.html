<h3>Carl Bass on His Surprising Resignation from Autodesk &#8212; and What&#8217;s Next</h3>
<p>Carl Bass is sitting at his desk at Autodesk today, but he’s no longer CEO of the publicly traded design software company. He stepped down earlier this week in a move that some associated — wrongly, notes Bass — with an <a href="https://pando.com/2017/02/06/autodesk-ceo-carl-bass-ive-been-batshit-about-trump-year-hes-acting-somewhere-between-dictator-and-small-business-owner/245af5a7f062b0f5f4427a3f338e1b601020ff58/">interview</a> Bass granted to the outlet Pando, wherein he disparaged President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>This morning, we talked with Bass about his resignation, his continuing role as a board member with Autodesk, if he regrets speaking out against the administration as a public company CEO, and whether he thinks more tech CEOs should do the same. The famously straight-shooting Bass had plenty to say about all. He also shared some of what he hopes to work on next. Our conversation has been edited lightly for length.</p>
<p><strong>You stepped down as CEO on Tuesday, and senior VPs Amar Hanspal and Andrew Anagnost have been installed as interim co-CEOs. But you’re helping in the search for your replacement, is that correct? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, Tuesday was my last day, but I’ll continue working as an employee for three months and am continuing on the board of directors for a while. We started planning this a while ago, because the best way to do [a succession change] is for the current CEO to step down. Otherwise, the best external candidates aren’t sure there’s really a job opening.  You know, sometimes you see the pocket veto, where the CEO has a change of heart and says, “Hey, if you’re going to choose so and so, I’m not leaving.” This is a clean break, and outside candidates take it seriously, and the board takes it seriously. We’ve hired an outside search team who will be talking with both internal and external candidates, so hopefully [we’ll find the right candidate] quickly.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve said that you and Autodesk’s board began succession planning talks 18 months ago, but some people believe an interview wherein you criticized Donald Trump played a role in the timing of your resignation.</strong></p>
<p>There were a lot of rumors this week that couldn’t be further from the truth. To the extent that you take what a company says with a grain of salt [because companies can be so promotional], when it comes to governance, these are real rules. There are real penalties of law. Public companies don’t take that lightly.</p>
<p><strong>Do you at all regret being so public about how you feel about Trump? </strong></p>
<p>Not, not at all. Not one bit. When you look at Trump, there are three things going on: policies; character and temperament; and executive or administrative functioning. I think on two and three, almost everybody can agree that he’s not qualified, and that’s why I joked [to Pando’s Sarah Lacy] that he’s running the government like someone in between a small businessman and dictator. I watch what’s happening every day, and I’m reminded of my kids when they were four years old and had no awareness of anything outside of themselves. He’s a 70-year-old baby.</p>
<p>On the policy stuff, it’s hard to parse what his is policy is. We’re against the “One China” policy; now we’re for it. We’re going to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jersusalem; now we’re not. Policy seems to be the part of the job that least interests him. These are complicated issues, but they don’t seem to captivate him. He doesn’t seem particularly curious or thoughtful about them. He’s more interested in tweeting out the latest insult that [springs to mind].</p>
<p><strong>Do you think other tech executives should be more vocal, or is too much of a risk?</strong></p>
<p>I think anybody who has a platform should speak out. I’ve had a ton of people reach out to me this week — people much better-known than I am, saying, “That’s awesome, what you said.” And I’m like, “Why don’t <em>you</em> say it? You have a bigger pulpit.”</p>
<p><strong>A lot of people think Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk should step off Trump’s economic advisory council. What do you think?</strong></p>
<p>It’s a complicated issue for Elon. I think many of the things he’s trying to accomplish are really worthy goals but they intersect with regulation: automomuos vehicles, putting things in space. You can’t do that without the government, so from very self-interested point of view, and in the interest of his companies, I understand. On the other hand, he has a very pubic platform and I’m sure he has an opinion and if everybody takes the self-interested view, the world doesn’t get to hear the opinions of its leaders. So I think it’s important but I certainly understand.</p>
<p>I’ve [feel even more strongly about Facebook COO] Sheryl Sandberg. She has gone out of her way to build a brand around the power of women and what they’re capable of, and when it comes to the Women’s March, she was invisible. She seems to have leaned out quite a bit.</p>

					<p>Happy Thursday, everyone!</p>
<p>Thanks very much to those of you who made it to our StrictlyVC event last night. We had <em>so</em> much fun, and the speakers &#8212; all of them &#8212; were outstanding.

<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p><strong>Twitter</strong> revealed its fourth quarter earnings earlier today. The big takeaway: its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/twitters-streamlining-efforts-still-arent-fixing-its-core-business-problems/">ad business is stalling</a>.</p>
<h3>What Software Engineers Around the World are Being Paid</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://hired.com/state-of-salaries-2017">new study</a> published by the data science team at Hired, a jobs marketplace for tech workers, shows why it&#8217;s becoming harder for software engineers to afford life in San Francisco, even while they make more money than their peers elsewhere in the U.S. and the world.</p>
<p>Based on 28,000 interview requests and job offers provided by more than 5,000 companies to 45,000 job seekers on Hired&#8217;s platform, the company&#8217;s data team has determined that the average salary for a software engineer in the Bay Area is $134,000. That&#8217;s more than software engineers anywhere in the country, through Seattle trails closely behind, paying engineers an average of $126,000. In other tech hubs, including Boston, Austin, L.A., New York, and Washington, D.C., software engineers are paid on average between $110,000 and $120,000.</p>
<p>Higher salaries don&#8217;t mean much with jaw-dropping rents and other soaring expenses associated with life in &#8220;Silicon Valley,&#8221; and San Francisco more specifically. Indeed, factoring in the cost of living, San Francisco is now one of the lowest-paying cities for software engineers, according to Hired&#8217;s lead data scientist, Jessica Kirkpatrick. According to her analysis, the $110,000 that an Austin engineer makes is the rough equivalent of being paid $198,000 in the Bay Area, considering how much further each dollar goes in the sprawling capital of Texas. The same is true of Melbourne, Australia, where software engineers are paid a comparatively low $107,000 on average, but who are making the equivalent of $150,000 in San Francisco.</p>

But news of his resignation also comes a day after the outlet Pando published an interview in which Bass spoke openly of his disdain for Donald Trump. &#8220;My concern is all on the personality side, the kookiness of the way [Trump is] operating, and the people he has surrounded himself with,&#8221; said Bass of the new administration. &#8220;Imagine we had a left-wing President, and he decided to appoint Arianna Huffington as the person to preside over the National Security Council.

<h3>A Debit Card for Kids That Parents Manage from their Phones</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.greenlightcard.com/">Greenlight</a>, a three-year-old, Atlanta, Ga.-based startup, is trying to solve a problem that any parent of an elementary or junior high school student can well understand: how to give kids money without worrying that they’ll lose it or spend it on something they shouldn’t.</p>
<p>It isn’t the first reloadable, prepaid card. MasterCard, Visa and American Express each offer parent-friendly debit cards, among other outfits. But Greenlight — backed with seed funding from its executive team and a startup incubator at Georgia Tech called the <a href="http://atdc.org/">Advanced Technology Development Center</a> — is hoping to take on these giants by adding every imaginable bell and whistle to its FDIC-insured offering, as well as making its pricing affordable and straightforward.</p>
<p>Because we have a seven- and nine-year-old — both of whom reliably lose whatever money we give them for field trips and the like — we were curious to learn more. Co-founder Johnson Cook answered some of our questions last week.</p>
<p><strong>Greenlight is a nice idea, but it has plenty of competition. How does what you’re offering differ from what’s out there already?</strong></p>
<p>[We think] Greenlight is the first card with store-level controls — in other words, the ability for a parent to give a child a specific amount that he or she can spend at a specific store or website — like Starbucks, Chick-fil- A, the neighborhood market store, Amazon.com. We found that the ability to choose the specific stores where their kids can shop really resonated with parents.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the card’s other features?</strong></p>
<p>Parents can automate allowances very easily in the app. We’re also rolling out a Greenlight Savings account and Greenlight Giving, which will give parents and their kids a full view of their finances across spending, savings and giving. We’re very focused on empowering parents to raise their kids to be financially smart: to learn to spend wisely, the importance of saving so they can cover unexpected expenses, how to build wealth through investing, and the importance of credit.</p>
<p><strong>What about notifications? I’d think these would be pretty important to parents.</strong></p>
<p>Parents are instantly alerted any time the card is used, letting them know how much was spent and where. And notifications are customizable for both parents and their kids. You can receive notifications for when purchases are made, transactions are declined, the child makes a new request, low balances, funds transfers, for when the card is turned on or off, and messages received.</p>
<p><strong>You charge $4.99 per family per month for up to five kids. How did you settle on that particular price point, and why do a monthly fee versus take some percentage from each transaction?</strong></p>

<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Uber CEO <strong>Travis Kalanick</strong> stepped down from the new administration&#8217;s economic advisory council. In an email to employees, he said his participation was being interpreted as a sign that he had endorsed the president and the administration’s agenda, when in reality, he thinks the  immigration order is hurting many people across America. (The New York Times looks at the various factors that drove Kalanick&#8217;s eventual decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-trump-advisory-council.html">here</a>.)

<h3>Essential Reads</h3>
<p><strong>Snap</strong>&#8216;s IPO prospectus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snap-has-finally-filed-publicly-for-its-massive-ipo/">was made public</a> yesterday, and reporters have been chewing through the numbers since. Among the many data points worth noting: Snap lost $515 million on $404 million in revenue in 2016, compared with the $373 million it lost on sales of $59 million in 2015.</p>
<p>Snap has a lot of users, but maybe less than you might have guessed: 158 million at the end up last year, up from 107 million in 2015, and growth appears to be slowing. The number of users rose 7 percent between the second and third quarters but grew just 3.3. percent in the last quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>Assuming the company is still valued out of the gate at between $20 billion and $25 billion, a select group of folks will make out exceedingly well. Among them, <strong>Benchmark</strong>, which owns 12.7 percent of the company, <strong>Lightspeed Venture Partners</strong>, which owns 8.3 percent, and cofounders <strong>Evan Spiegel </strong>and <strong>Bobby Murphy</strong>, both of whom own 21.8 percent of the company. (Turns out <strong>Reggie Brown</strong>, a third cofounder who was bounced out of the company early on, has done okay, too, having received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown">$157.5 million settlement </a>after he sued Spiegel and Murphy for his fair share of the business.)</p>

<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p>A Dallas jury decided yesterday that <strong>Facebook</strong> will need to shell out $500 million to tech company ZeniMax in a lawsuit that questioned the origins of the virtual reality headset <strong>Oculus Rift</strong>. The jury found that cofounder <strong>Palmer Lucky</strong> did not comply with a non-disclosure agreement he had signed; it also said that Oculus did not steal trade secrets, as alleged by ZeniMax in its suit. <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14474198/oculus-lawsuit-verdict">More here</a>.</p>
<h3>Dropcam Cofounder Aamir Virani Joins Felicis</h3>
<p>Last week, we learned that Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy has headed over <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/dropcams-greg-duffy-joins-apple">to Apple</a>. Today, Felicis Ventures, the early-stage venture firm, is disclosing it has brought aboard Dropcam’s other cofounder, Aamir Virani, as its newest partner.</p>
<p>The move seems a perfect fit for both sides. Felicis wrote one of the earliest checks to Dropcam, an internet-connected security camera company that was sold to Nest Labs in 2014 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/20/google-and-nest-acquire-dropcam-for-555-million/">$555 million</a>, months after Nest was itself acquired by Google for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-3-2-billion-purchase-of-nest/">$3.2 billion</a>.</p>
<p>As StrictlyVC reported in <a href="http://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/11/12/unrest-nest/">late 2014</a>, the acquisition proved far from a seamless fit, and by last year, Duffy had <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/3/29/11587344/dropcam-duffy-nest-google-mistake">gone public</a> about his regrets over selling Dropcam to Nest, which he left in 2015.</p>
<p>For his part, however, Virani — who also left Nest in 2015 — stayed mum, calling Google “one of the great companies” of the world during a call earlier this week. Explaining his departure, he said simply that “I wasn’t really a big company person. I just don’t think that mentality is right for me. I like trying to figure out how to make something useful for customers, then figuring out how to create a business that will ensure it survives.”</p>
<p>It largely explains why, over the past year or so, Virani has chosen to do a limited amount of angel investing and to advise a small group of startups, many of them through his network, which includes friends from Rice University, where the Houston native nabbed his undergraduate degree, and Stanford, where he went to grad school.</p>

<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p>Online lender <strong>Social Finance</strong> is acquiring a digital-banking startup as it looks to accelerate its expansion into more pockets of consumer finance (and become the central financial services hub for its customers). Its new purchase: <strong>Zenbanx Holding</strong>, a four-year-old firm that offers online and mobile bank accounts in multiple currencies and performs international money transfers. Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed, but a WSJ source pegs the all-stock deal valued at nearly $100 million. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/online-lender-sofi-buys-digital-banking-startup-1485957600">More here</a>.</p>
<h3>Why East Coast Investors are Better Off if the Market Turns</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/trends/">new trends report</a> published by the law firm Cooley report suggests that the venture market remains largely healthy for now. In the fourth quarter, for example, Cooley handled 187 &#8220;disclosable&#8221; (versus stealth) deals that represented more than $2.7 billion of invested capital. That&#8217;s 18 percent more deals than it closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 &#8212; though the amount of money involved fell 23 percent from the year-earlier period. (VCs were writing smaller checks into a greater number of startups.)</p>
<p>Of slightly more interest to us were the deal terms involved in these fundings, some of which suggest that East Coast VCs have more safeguards than their West Coast peers if the market changes.</p>
<p>We talked with one of the study&#8217;s author, Cooley attorney Dave Young, about what he found and what it might mean.</p>
<p><strong>This report seems pretty positive on its face.</strong></p>
<p>I think it shows a surprisingly strong, healthy venture market. In 2015, there was this sense that maybe things were getting overheated, with nontraditional investors coming in and leading later-stage rounds in companies that hadn’t proven themselves yet. And that led to the view that things would slow down meaningfully in 2016. That didn&#8217;t really happen, though. People were being more disciplined around valuations and the size of rounds, but a lot of deals were getting done.</p>
<p><strong>You also focus on the terms in this report. Are you starting to see anything onerous? </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say founder-friendly terms are still really prevailing, and by that I mean plain vanilla terms. Whenever we inevitably head back to where the economy turns down, terms will get tough, and the levers will shift back toward [investors].</p>
<p><strong>So no pay-to-play provisions [meaning if a company needs to raise money and resorts to insiders for it, those who can’t or don’t want to contribute their pro rata share will see their preferred shares reduced to either common stock or some other subset of equity with fewer rights]. I think there was some expectation that those would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/pay-to-play-how-investors-get-burned-fast-in-a-downturn/">start reappearing</a> in deals as this tech boom runs on and on.</strong></p>
<p>We’re seeing some, but it&#8217;s been steady over the last three or four quarters or so, which is a good sign. We&#8217;re seeing them in situations when it makes sense &#8212; when it’s the right tool for that particular situation. But it’s not something people are defaulting to.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes with those down rounds and recaps and pay-to-plays, there&#8217;s a bit of a lag, because if companies are having a hard time getting funded, earlier investors will put in six, nine, 12 months of cash. If you have $10 million in a company already, you&#8217;d rather do that than see it crater. But you only do it once. Without a new lead investor and a new plan, those companies [are going to go out of business].</p>
<p><strong>East Coast investors have historically been a little more metrics-driven than West Coast investors. Is that still true and does that impact how the market could shake out if there&#8217;s a downturn?</strong></p>
<p>This has always been the case, but you see East Coast terms that are way more investor favorable, compared with West Coast [terms]. It&#8217;s more surprising to me that that hasn&#8217;t changed over time.</p>
<p><strong>How do the terms differ, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>In East Coast deals, you see more of what are called redemption provisions and cumulative dividends. Redemption provisions basically give investors the right to be bought out four or five years down the line &#8212; to get their money back if a company joins the living dead. They&#8217;re very rarely seen in Silicon Valley, but they appear in 25 to 30 percent of the deals on the East Coast.</p>

<h3>In Silicon Valley, Plotting to Get Foreign-Born Workers to Vancouver</h3>
<p>For many U.S. startups and their foreign-born employees, a kind of back-up plan may be starting to sound like a good idea right about now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that administration officials have drafted a new executive order aimed at overhauling, among other things, the H-1B work-visa program that U.S.-based tech companies have long relied on to bring top foreign engineering talent into their ranks. Spicer said the possible executive order is “part of a larger immigration effort” related in part to Friday’s hot-button immigration ban targeting immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-30/trump-s-next-move-on-immigration-to-hit-closer-to-home-for-tech" target="_blank">According to Bloomberg</a>, the draft proposal states that: “Our country’s immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest. Visa programs for foreign workers … should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers — our forgotten working people — and the jobs they hold.” (The shorter version: companies have to try hiring U.S.-born employees first.)</p>
<p>Whether and when that executive order gets signed is an open question, but at least one small group of cofounders has banded together to make it easier for U.S. companies to create subsidiaries in Canada and to move their U.S.-based employees to a new, Vancouver-based office, and all within what they describe as weeks, not months. They haven’t created a nonprofit. They’ve instead formed a new company called <a href="https://www.thetruenorth.me/" target="_blank">True North </a>that’s right now offering a $6,000 package that includes airfare for one person to Vancouver, two nights of accommodations, and a day with “world-class immigration professionals who will walk you through the process and answer any questions you have.”</p>
<p>The package is somewhat rich.</p>

					<p>Hi, everyone. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/travelers-detained-nyc-airport-immigration-freeze/">What a weekend</a>. Blergh.</p>
<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p>Trump out. Refugees in.&#8221; <strong>Silicon Valley companies</strong> entered the debate over Trump’s immigration policy this weekend, criticizing a new, seven-country immigration ban of people from predominantly Muslim countries and, in some cases, outlining plans to support the employees it affects.</p>
<p>Among the fastest to respond, <strong>Airbnb</strong> offered <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/airbnb-is-offering-free-housing-to-those-turned-away-by-trum?utm_term=.etxyxoxJRP#.ryaXmQmznp">free housing</a> to those who flew into the U.S. Friday night, only to discover they wouldn&#8217;t be allowed on to their destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Sergey Brin</strong>, Google co-founder and president of Alphabet, joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport Saturday night as demonstrators assembled at airports across the country in opposition to the immigration order. Brin told The Verge that he was attending “in a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14428262/google-sergey-brin">personal capacity</a>” and would not be giving comment. But Forbes’ Ryan Mac separately overheard him saying, “I’m here because I’m a refugee.”</p>
<p>Y Combinator <strong>Sam Altman</strong> was also at the SFO protest, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2017/01/29/y-combinators-sam-altman-this-may-be-a-defining-moment-when-people-oppose-trump/#5740a4221e47">telling Forbes</a>, &#8220;I hope this will be one of the defining moments where people came together against this administration. This is an unacceptable action, and we need to make our voices heard.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong>, the ride-hailing company, also reacted strongly, saying it will be donating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/29/lyft-donates-1m-to-the-aclu-condemns-trumps-immigration-actions/">$1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union</a> over the next four years. (The ACLU filed suit against Trump’s administration for the refugee ban, and succeeded in getting a temporary stay of the order from a federal judge on Saturday.)</p>
<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, meanwhile, who is now a member of an advisory board that will be meeting quarterly at the White House to talk about manufacturing, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561">tweeted (somewhat dispassionately)</a>, &#8220;The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges.&#8221; (The Archbishop of Chicago agrees, <a href="http://time.com/4652942/chicago-archbishop-donald-trump-immigration-ban/">writing yesterday</a> that the weekend &#8220;proved to be a dark moment in U.S. history&#8221; and that the executive order runs &#8220;contrary to both Catholic and American values.&#8221;)</p>
<p>By yesterday, White House chief of staff <strong>Reince Priebus</strong> appeared to reverse a key part of the immigration order, saying that people from the affected countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/white-house-official-in-reversal-says-green-card-holders-wont-be-barred.html">who hold green cards</a> will not be prevented from returning to the U.S., but that border agents have “discretionary authority” to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries. A number of federal judges across the country also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-29/trump-immigration-order-blocked-by-boston-federal-judge-too">halted</a> the implementation of the order. According to reports this morning, however, U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees continue to detain people coming into the country.</p>
<p>According to a new Bloomberg report, it could <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-30/trump-s-next-move-on-immigration-to-hit-closer-to-home-for-tech">get worse, too</a>, particularly for high-tech companies. The outlet has reviewed a draft of an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programs they depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.  If implemented, the companies would have to try to hire American first, and if they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid.</p>
<h3>With Snap&#8217;s IPO Around the Corner, L.A.&#8217;s Amplify Lands New Fund</h3>
<p>L.A. is getting a star turn, with the most iconic of its local startups — <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/">Snap</a> — on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/27/snap-will-reportedly-file-publicly-for-its-massive-ipo-late-next-week/">cusp</a> of going public. Locals expect much more than an endless string of headlines about its IPO performance, too. “The initial performance of the stock will be almost irrelevant,” says Paul Bricault, cofounder of the L.A.-based accelerator and seed-stage venture fund <a href="http://amplify.la/">Amplify</a>. “The IPO will shine a bigger spotlight on L.A. tech, and it will likely spin out more Snap execs as founders of new startups over time —  as well as likely inject more capital into angel funding of startups in L.A.”</p>
<p>Bricault has reason for optimism. Five-year-old Amplify just closed its third fund with $10 million, and it could use new, promising startups  to fund, as well as more capital sloshing around L.A. for follow-on funding. Investing $12.6 million across its first two funds, Amplify has already invested in 50 startups. Fourteen have raised a Series A round, five have raised a Series B round, and ten have subsequently been shut down.</p>
<p>Amplify has nurtured almost all of them at its campus in Venice, Ca., where companies of various, early stages stay for five months on average and are given opportunities to meet with investors for whom they would seem to be a fit. (Rather than stage demo days, Amplify invites investors to its offices four times a year for pre-arranged one-on-one meetings with its portfolio companies.)</p>
<p>On average, the firm, led by Bricault (who is also a venture partner with Greycroft Partners), takes a 10 percent stake in each company in exchange for mentorship, introductions, and initial checks of between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>Bricault says a proliferation of seed-stage funds is already helping Amplify’s companies attract funding in their “post accelerator round,” but that L.A. is still falling short when it comes to Series A, B, and later rounds.</p>
