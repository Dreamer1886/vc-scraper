<h2 align="left">Mithril, Led by Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan, Closes New Fund with Roughly $850M</h2>
<p>Peter Thiel being suddenly cast into the center of U.S. politics in 2016 isn’t something that either Thiel or his longtime friend and colleague Ajay Royan could have anticipated in 2014, when they founded Mithril Capital Management. But it doesn’t change much for the low-flying, 12-person firm, which is based in San Francisco but makes outsize bets on companies that are largely outside of the Bay Area.</p>
<p>In fact, Royan insists that Thiel’s position on President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team had no discernible impact on fundraising for its second and newest fund, which the firm just closed with $850 million, including management fees.</p>
<p>“It’s been interesting,” Royan says of Trump’s divisive win. “As observers, we’re fascinated by what’s going on; there seem to be a lot of issues that are conflated by social media and so forth. But on a day-to-day basis, what we think about and what we do hasn’t changed at all. Maybe if we were more Silicon Valley focused, we might feel it more. My social media feed is more activated around the [election results] than my business relationships.”</p>
<p>Some of those business relationships center on Mithril’s investors, mostly family offices in the U.S., Europe and Canada and limited enough in number than Royan spends a couple of hours with each every quarter, rather than host a formal annual meeting.</p>
<p>“Having a small base allows you to give people individual updates,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We can talk about the fullness of their business and the fullness of our business.”</p>
<p>They have plenty to discuss, surely. Mithril, which closed its first fund with roughly $540 million, has now invested in 22 companies, including the data analytics company Palantir, cofounded by Thiel; C2FO, a nine-year-old, Kansas City-based collaborative cash-flow optimization company that tries unlocking capital trapped in trade relationships; Adimab, a 10-year-old, Lebanon, New Hampshire-based antibody drug discovery startup; and a nine-year-old, Redwood City, Ca.-based surgical robotics company called Auris Surgical Robotics, whose founder Royan gleefully describes as having the “energy of 99 founders.”</p>
<p>(That founder, Dr. Frederic Moll, has cofounded several companies previously, including Intuitive Surgical, a 20-year-old, publicly traded company that makes robotic surgical systems and is valued at $25 billion.)</p>
<p>Mithil doesn’t have any exits to speak of yet, but investors sign up for a portfolio that’s fairly concentrated. Its debut fund committed $100 million to one (undisclosed) company, for example, and its median check size is $50 million. (Royan says that Adimab has now received more investment from Mithril than any other company it has funded. Wired profiled it <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/mutant-yeast-cranking-pharmas-next-superdrug/">last year</a>.)</p>
<p>Investors also agree to a longer-than-usual ride with Mithril, whose funds have 12-year-long investing periods, giving Royan and Thiel the flexibility to make bets in established companies that aren’t yet ready to go public.</p>
<p>For example, C2FO is now clearing a billion dollars in transaction volume every day, up from a billion dollars every quarter in 2014, when Mithril invested in the company. Yet asked if an IPO is in sight for 2017, Royan says C2FO has no plans to go public yet and that he generally believes there should be a “line of sight to saturation” before an outfit starts talking with investment bankers.</p>
<p>“You want the public markets to have the confidence that yours in the last company in its category that they need to be thinking about,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Royan also holds up C2FO as the kind of company that Mithril pursues in part because it’s outside of Silicon Valley. “I love that I have to be in Kanas City five times a year,&#8221; he says, speaking from Mithril&#8217;s sleek offices in the leafy Presidio, a former military base turned national park.</p>
<p>Kansas, he says, is among many places where individuals, including founders, can have a very different perspective and life experience than that of the &#8220;top-notch MIT grad or Stanford grad who lives in San Francisco or a place that consciously or unconsciously looks like it, including parts of Boston, large parts of New York &#8212; even Berlin, Stockholm and London, which very much have a Silicon Valley state of mind.”</p>
<p>I ask Royan if, as Thiel has suggested, he thinks Silicon Valley &#8212; where Mithril has funded seven companies altogether &#8212; has become too disconnected from the rest of the country.</p>

<h2 align="left">Facebook Agreed to Pay More for Oculus Than We Realized; Here&#8217;s Why</h2>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a Dallas court yesterday as part of a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-palmer-luckey-to-testify-in-2-billion-zenimax-lawsuit-against-oculus-vr-2017-1">lawsuit</a> claiming that Oculus VR, the startup Facebook acquired for roughly $2 billion, was based on stolen technology. Unsurprisingly, Zuckerberg defended Oculus and in the process revealed a number of new details about the negotiations involved in purchasing the company. Among them: that Facebook agreed to pay <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/821372823499403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$700 million</a> in employee retention bonuses for &#8220;key people.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was news to the rest of us. When Facebook <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/">announced the deal</a> back in 2014, it said it was paying a &#8220;total of approximately&#8221; $2 billion, including $400 million in cash and  23.1 million shares of Facebook. It said the agreement &#8220;also provides for an additional $300 million earn-out in cash and stock&#8221; based on Oculus meeting certain milestones. It said bupkis about that extra $700 million in retention bonuses.</p>
<p>Was its own release &#8220;<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/01/17/facebook-oculus-price/#NKH1WR0r2kqu">fake news</a>?&#8221; It&#8217;s commonly known that the actual price paid for a company and what the public sees in headlines is rarely the same, owing to factors like the fluctuating value of an acquirer&#8217;s stock. But a $700 million difference? Isn&#8217;t that notable?</p>
<p>Actually, no, said a handful of bankers and analysts with whom we spoke yesterday. Here&#8217;s why. That original press release from Facebook addressed the price paid for Oculus to its former owners (including its founders, Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, and Spark Capital, among others). That&#8217;s the $2 billion, plus that $300 million earn-out component.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the $700 million that Zuckerberg referenced yesterday takes into account the ongoing costs following the close of the deal, and those costs &#8212; in the form of employee incentives &#8212; aren&#8217;t typically considered in the purchase price as they&#8217;re paid out over time, as one co-chair of a corporate securities group told us.</p>
<p>In short, new employees have to work for that money.</p>
<p>Tom Peters, cofounder of the San Francisco-based investment bank Iverness Advisors, agrees with that view. As a former managing director at Montgomery &amp; Co., Peters worked on the sale of MySpace to News Corp. in 2005, and says that while the deal is referred to this day as costing <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/murdoch-says-580-million-myspace-buy-a-huge-mistake-2011-10">$580 million</a>, it was really $630 million by the time every i was dotted and t was crossed. &#8220;The devil is always in the details,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>When it comes to this particular disparity, while it may seem &#8220;shockingly big,&#8221; he says the money that was set aside for compensation to certain Oculus employees for continuing to work at Facebook must have been separated out from purchase price, which is a &#8220;not uncommon&#8221; practice, he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s often viewed as in a different category, including because of accounting guidelines that tell you to account for things in different ways.&#8221; (He notes, for example, that tax treatments and tax consequences differ when it comes to purchase prices versus compensation.)</p>
<p>In the end, &#8220;it was a judgment call,&#8221; says a San Francisco-based investment banker who asked not to be named. &#8220;Certainly, Facebook could have mentioned the possibility of additional payments at the time of the acquisition. Then again, does it want to be known for paying big retention bonuses and earn-outs? You can see the case [for leaving out that information].&#8221;</p>

<h2 align="left">Joe Lonsdale Moves Forward with 8VC&#8217;s New Fund and More</h2>
<p>Joe Lonsdale has had his fair share of ups and downs in recent years. Investors don’t seem to mind. Nearly a year ago, they quietly provided Lonsdale’s newest, early-stage venture firm, <a href="http://8vc.com/">8VC</a>, with $425 million in funding for its debut fund, along with $50 million for a separate seed fund. The firm, which is run by five partners, has since invested a quarter of that capital in an array of companies, including, most recently, Synthego, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/dealbook/synthego-raises-41-million-from-investors-including-a-top-biochemist.html?_r=0">genetic engineering startup</a> that provides scientists with genetic material used in their Crispr research.</p>
<p>Lonsdale declined to comment on 8VC’s fundraising last year. But last week, we spoke with him about the new fund and, to a much lesser extent, about Formation 8 Partners, which Lonsdale <a href="http://fortune.com/2013/04/11/the-hottest-vcs-since-andreessen/">famously cofounded</a> in 2011 with Stanford classmate Brian Koo and longtime venture investor Jim Kim before the three <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/10/what-caused-formation-8-to-split-and-what-comes-next/">abruptly disbanded</a> in 2015. One oft-cited reason for the firm’s demise: differing opinions about strategy.</p>
<p>Koo has since founded another firm: <a href="http://formationgroup.com/">Formation Group</a>, which hews most closely to Formation 8’s mission, which was to bridge the ecosystems between Asian countries and Silicon Valley. Kim has also cofounded a new venture firm called <a href="http://builders.vc/">Builders</a>, which we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/formation-8-founder-jim-kim-and-longtime-vc-paul-lee-partner-on-a-new-fund-called-builders/">last month</a>. Its big idea: to help nascent companies gets sales and marketing staff involved early.</p>
<p>8VC’s mantra is simply, “The world is broken; let’s fix it.”</p>
<p>That approach helps explain its bet on Synthego. It also accounts for a perhaps more controversial bet on <a href="https://hyperloop-one.com/">Hyperloop One</a>, an ambitious company aiming to build faster, cleaner long-distance travel through a supersonic transit system that remains largely theoretical for now. (The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/10/25/hyperloop-one-seeks-new-cash-amid-high-costs/#63a81fa47854">well-funded</a> company, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/hyperloop-one-has-settled-the-lawsuit-with-former-co-founder-brogan-bambrogan/">settled a lawsuit</a> with one of its cofounders and several former employees, is currently engaged in numerous <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hyperloop-one-feasibility-study-dubai-roads-and-transport-authority-2016-11">feasibility</a> studies.)</p>
<p>8VC’s mission also underscores what Lonsdale most wants to focus on — the future.</p>

<h2 align="left">Bitcoin Booster Pantera Capital Stays the Course, Targeting a $25M New Fund</h2>
<p>The digital currency bitcoin began 2017 with a bang, soaring to its highest level in more than three years to reach $1,150 – a record high.</p>
<p>Since then, its price has more fallen more the 30 percent as nervous Chinese authorities put local bitcoin exchanges on notice that more regulations may be coming.</p>
<p>To Dan Morehead — a former head of macro trading at Tiger Global who today runs his own San Francisco-based investment firm — such zigs and zags are hardly a surprise. His shop, <a href="https://panteracapital.com/">Pantera Capital</a>, has been exclusively focused on bitcoin and other digital currencies since 2011, and he argues that its price is “actually very predictable.” We talked with him late last week to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin has been going bananas lately. Why?</strong></p>
<p>With the exception of a bubble in 2013, the price is actually very predictable and has been rising along with the actual use of bitcoin. It was [trending up] slowly for a while because Ethereum [an open source public blockchain-based distributed computing platform] was supposed to be <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-co-founder-ethereum-blow-past-bitcoin/">taking over</a> – bitcoin was facing questions over its governance structure – but then Ethereum faded and bitcoin surged back.</p>
<p>That it reached another digit – into a thousand dollars – has gotten people excited, but its price has been grinding up for two years.</p>
<p><strong>How many bitcoins are currently in circulation?</strong></p>
<p>There are 16.09 million bitcoins now, with a roughly $14.4 billion market cap. In a hundred years, there will be 21 million bitcoins. So more than two-thirds of bitcoins have already been issued.</p>
<p>Early on, 50 bitcoins were issued every 10 minutes, then it was 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes, now it’s 12.5 and in another four years it’ll go to 6.25. So as their value is appreciating, the number of bitcoins that are being issued is being cut in half. The total value is going up fast as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Where do those 16 million bitcoins mostly reside?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no solid data on this, but anecdotally, it’s extremely popular in China because a lot of the transaction processors – or bitcoin miners — are there as chip manufacturing is there and electricity is inexpensive because of big hydro plans. Also, with Chinese currency devaluing and speculation that the country’s banking system is suspect or bankrupt, it’s a great way for citizens to store their wealth; some see it as a safer depository institution than their bank.</p>
<p><strong>Why would anyone ever use the currency, versus merely hold it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s definitely enticing for an investor to hold bitcoin, because they can buy more assets in the future. We have a fund where we’re investing in digital currency startups, but we have another where we invest in the currency and just hold it because we think it’ll be more valuable in the future.</p>
<p><strong>How much bitcoin has that second fund of yours amassed?</strong></p>

					<p>Hi, happy Wednesday, everyone! Know we&#8217;re a little late &#8212; we&#8217;re still trying to recover from that press conference this morning.</p>

<h2 align="left">Precursor Ventures Raises $15.3 Million for Seed Investing, with a Twist</h2>
<p>Charles Hudson has lived in the Bay Area for the last 20 years, working as product manager, as an entrepreneur, and an investor. As such, he’s had a front row seat to a number of changes in the way that startup are funding, including the evolution of numerous angel investors into so-called micro VCs into fund managers who are now responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Take investor Jeff Clavier, who began sprinkling tiny amounts of money across what appeared to be a new crop of capital-efficient startups back in 2004 and soon after launched a firm, SoftTechVC, where Hudson would become a partner in 2013. By 2014, SoftTech had closed a fourth fund with $85 million. Last June, it closed on a record $150 million across two funds.</p>
<p>Hudson was cheering on the firm &#8212; from down the street in San Francisco. Since last year, he has been creating his own brand, Precursor Ventures, to seize on the funding vacuum creating by firms like SoftTech that can no longer write small checks. Hudson, one of few African American VCs in the Bay Area, also sees another underserved opportunity in funding women and other minorities.</p>
<p>We talked with Hudson last week about how he&#8217;s approaching both missions and whether they were a difficult, or easy, sell for Precursor&#8217;s investors, who&#8217;ve given the company $15.3 million for its first fund.</p>
<p><strong>Why strike out on your own with a new fund?</strong></p>
<p>The big observation for me was that all the micro VC funds are really big now and they&#8217;ve stopped doing classic seed-stage funding. The goal for Precursor is to write checks in the range of $150,000 to $250,000 to teams that have maybe two founders and a prototype and probably not much in the way of a launched product or traction, with about 20 percent of the capital set aside to participate in [slightly more mature] companies that are maybe raising $2 million on a $6 million [pre-money] valuation.</p>
<p><strong>How many companies do you think you can support with this new fund?</strong></p>
<p>The idea is to write 18 to 20 checks per year, so I&#8217;ve made 50 investments over the last two years, including [as I was raising this fund].</p>
<p><strong>And investors didn&#8217;t think that was too much, that you were spreading your investments too thin? Why not go in the exact opposite direction and make lesser, more concentrated bets?</strong></p>
<p>For one thing, because there is so little institutional capital at the pre-seed stage, I felt like I could be more aggressive. Also, because of the rising cost of doing business in San Francisco, and because a lot of the founders I back don&#8217;t need to be here, I&#8217;ve encouraged many of them to stay where they are &#8212; in Tampa and Raleigh and Charleston and Baltimore. And it&#8217;s pretty cool to see how much more capital efficient they can be in these regions with $150,000 to $250,0000 in backing.</p>
<p><strong>Are you leading most of these rounds?</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d lead, but we do lead a lot, because without us, these rounds don&#8217;t come together. It&#8217;s sort of like, everyone is in for $25,000, but no one wants to issue terms. Believing in people early and being able to issue terms helps rounds come together.</p>

					<p>Hi, happy Tuesday, everyone! Tons of news to track today, so let&#8217;s dive right in.</p>

<h2 align="left">That Strange New Lawsuit Against Investor Michael Goguen was Just Dropped</h2>
<p>Early <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/1424852/">last month</a>, we told you about a bizarre new lawsuit involving longtime venture capitalist Michael Goguen, whose long career at Sequoia Capital ended early last year after he was sued in a salacious <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/304104968/Goguen-Baptiste-San-Mateo-Court?content=10079&amp;ad_group=Online+Tracking+Link&amp;campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&amp;keyword=ft500noi&amp;source=impactradius&amp;medium=affiliate&amp;irgwc=1">breach of contract</a> suit that accused him of sexually mistreating a woman named Amber Baptiste, then refusing to honor an elaborate financial arrangement they’d made.</p>
<p>Baptiste and Goguen are set to meet in court this coming May. But the newer suit, filed the first week of December by a former acquaintance named Bryan Nash, was just dropped — and not surprisingly given the circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Nash’s suit, he first met Goguen in 1994 and they became “friends.” As Nash and Goguen’s “friendship developed,” they enjoyed “joint family gatherings,” took “vacations together,” went “mountain biking together,” and also exercised together, it said.</p>
<p>After skipping over two decades (that&#8217;s not an exaggeration), Nash&#8217;s suit proceeded to claim that last year, Goguen agreed to pay Nash $15 million &#8212; and an eventual $19 million altogether &#8212; for &#8220;unrelated professional and personal assistance to Goguen.&#8221; The issue at the crux of the suit was that “before the funds were deposited through the wire transfer,” Goguen then &#8220;withheld, or revoked” the transfer.</p>
<p>None of Nash’s complaint added up, as you’ve probably surmised yourself, but that didn’t stop a Mission Viejo, Ca.-based <a href="http://www.rjmlawfirm.com/">personal injury law firm</a> from agreeing to represent Nash in his lawsuit.</p>
<p>At least, until yesterday.</p>

<h2 align="left">A Startup that Makes Every Day a Payday Just Raised a $22M Series A</h2>
<p>What if you didn’t have to wait every two weeks to receive a paycheck?</p>
<p>What if you could be wired the money you earned almost immediately after a shift?</p>
<p>What if, unlike with payday lenders, you didn’t have to pay interest on those payments? Instead, you were merely encouraged to donate a kind of tip to the company providing you with this service?</p>
<p>That’s the proposition of <a href="https://www.activehours.com/">Activehours</a>, a four-year-old, Palo Alto, Ca.-based financial services startup that aims to turn the payroll process on its head — and which just raised $22 million in Series A funding toward that end, led by Matrix Partners.</p>
<p>The company basically serves as kind of ATM, letting consumers who’ve accrued earnings pay for transactions like an unexpected car repair or an overdue bill without being charged onerous overdraft fees from their bank or else a high-interest payday lender. Activehours doesn’t charge interest, either, but rather invites people to provide it with a non-obligatory tip that they think is fair for the service.</p>
<p>Activehours doesn’t take into consideration a person’s credit history. It doesn’t ask for a social security number. Anyone who has a checking account and a job can use the service, regardless of their employer, though Activehours has <a href="http://www.retaildive.com/news/sears-activehours-team-to-give-shop-your-way-members-store-associates-pay/430391/">struck partnerships</a> with companies, including Sears Holdings (which owns Sears and Kmart), to make it easier for its employees to access their accrued pay before their paychecks arrive. The company also also teamed up with Uber, whose drivers need only connect their bank information and Uber account information with Activehours in order to cash out after a shift.</p>
<p>In another interesting twist, anyone on the platform can also “tip” on behalf of someone else on the platform, an act that’s done entirely anonymously. Think of it like paying a toll booth operator for your own car, as well as for the car that’s behind you.)</p>
<p>“This is a service for the barista, or the person working in bookstore, or a teller at a bank,” says Matrix general partner Dana Stalder who led the deal for his firm. “It is the 50 percent of [the U.S. population] that has revolving debt on their credit cards — plus another big cross section of those who don’t.”</p>
<p>But no fees? No interest? How can this possibly work as a business, especially as the company scales?</p>

<h2 align="left">The Billion Dollar Pharma Startup That Silicon Valley Totally Missed</h2>
<p>When it comes to millennials and health care companies, recent history gives plenty of reason for pause. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of Theranos, has watched her star fall precipitously over the last year, amid a continuing drumbeat of allegations that her blood testing company <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/explosive-new-details-emerge-in-lawsuit-against-theranos">never worked as advertised</a>. Meanwhile, Martin Shkreli, a young hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical executive, was for a while the country’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/09/27/heres-how-to-punch-martin-shkreli-in-the-face/#658715b722c1">most reviled</a> businessperson, after his relatively small company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought a drug that treats toxoplasmosis, and promptly raised its price from less than $20 per tablet to $750.</p>
<p>If these black marks on the industry are slowing down 31-year-old Vivek Ramaswamy in any way, you wouldn’t know it. He thinks his company, <a href="http://roivant.com/">Roivant</a>, will one day be a giant holding company for dozens of independent biopharmaceutical companies – both by developing drugs as well as focusing squarely on reducing the time and cost of the drug development process.</p>
<p>It all sounds rather lofty. Then again, it’s hard to argue why Ramaswamy <em>shouldn’t</em> be the one to reshape how drugs are brought to market.</p>
<p>A Cincinnati native who studied biology at Harvard then earned a law degree from Yale, it was when Ramaswamy began working as an analyst in 2007 at the hedge fund <a href="http://www.qvt.com/files/approach.html">QVT Financial</a> in New York that he first observed the problem that defines his work today. What he noticed: that many big and small pharmaceutical firms abandon promising drugs for various reasons having nothing to do with their efficacy. Sometimes, it’s a strategic decision to focus elsewhere; sometimes, it owes to a lack of resources. Seeing an opportunity to complete the development of some of these abandoned late-stage drug candidates and get them to market quickly, Ramaswamy struck out on his own in 2014.</p>
<p>Having earned the trust of QVT was key. The firm, along with <a href="http://www.dexcel.com/">Dexcel Pharma</a>, an Israeli firm that reviewed Ramaswamy’s work at QVT, provided Ramaswamy’s new holding company with just less than $100 million in capital – a feat, given that he was just 28 years old at the time.</p>
<p>Yet what Ramaswamy has done with Roivant in the years since is pretty remarkable, too.</p>
<p>While Silicon Valley has obsessed over Theranos, Ramaswamy has acquired a dozen drugs, including an Alzheimer’s pill that’s named, for now, RVT-101. He also formed a company around that drug, <a href="http://axovant.com/">Axovant Science</a>, and took it public in 2015 – despite that the drug’s Phase 3 results won’t be out until this year.</p>
<p>It became the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/11/biggest-biotech-ipo-ever-and-the-ceo-is-29.html">biggest biotech IPO ever</a> in the U.S., raising $360 million. It has largely held up, too. Axovant’s shares, which opened at $15, currently trade around $13.25.</p>
<p>Roivant has also launched <a href="http://www.enzyvant.com/">Enzyvant Sciences</a>, a company focused on rare genetic pediatric conditions that Ramaswamy calls “ignored and underserved, ” including a metabolic disorder called Farber disease and DiGeorge syndrome, a genetic disease that results in poor development of several body systems.</p>
<p>Roivant has also teamed up with one of Japan’s oldest companies, Takeda Pharmaceuticals to start <a href="http://myovant.com/">Myovant Sciences</a>, a standalone company that’s focused on women’s health issues. The drug candidate around which the company is centered is called Relugolix, which aims to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Takeda is currently conducting two Phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan.</p>
