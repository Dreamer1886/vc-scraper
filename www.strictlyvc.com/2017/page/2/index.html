					<p>This will sound familiar, but we are again racing out the door to a doctor&#8217;s appointment &#8212; this time to see our friendly neighborhood dentist. Why do we make appointments in the morning, the worst possible time of the day for us to do this? We may well contemplate this today while our gums are being prodded.</p>
<p>No column today, but happy Friday, everyone; we&#8217;ll see you back here Monday.:) (Speaking of which, if you were thinking of coming to the Crunchies awards on Monday night in San Francisco, it&#8217;s not too late to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/event-info/10th-annual-crunchies-awards/">grab a ticket here</a>.)</p>
<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Uber CEO <strong>Travis Kalanick</strong> stepped down from the new administration&#8217;s economic advisory council. In an email to employees, he said his participation was being interpreted as a sign that he had endorsed the president and the administration’s agenda, when in reality, he thinks the  immigration order is hurting many people across America. (The New York Times looks at the various factors that drove Kalanick&#8217;s eventual decision <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick-trump-advisory-council.html">here</a>.)

<h3>Essential Reads</h3>
<p><strong>Snap</strong>&#8216;s IPO prospectus <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snap-has-finally-filed-publicly-for-its-massive-ipo/">was made public</a> yesterday, and reporters have been chewing through the numbers since. Among the many data points worth noting: Snap lost $515 million on $404 million in revenue in 2016, compared with the $373 million it lost on sales of $59 million in 2015.</p>
<p>Snap has a lot of users, but maybe less than you might have guessed: 158 million at the end up last year, up from 107 million in 2015, and growth appears to be slowing. The number of users rose 7 percent between the second and third quarters but grew just 3.3. percent in the last quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>Assuming the company is still valued out of the gate at between $20 billion and $25 billion, a select group of folks will make out exceedingly well. Among them, <strong>Benchmark</strong>, which owns 12.7 percent of the company, <strong>Lightspeed Venture Partners</strong>, which owns 8.3 percent, and cofounders <strong>Evan Spiegel </strong>and <strong>Bobby Murphy</strong>, both of whom own 21.8 percent of the company. (Turns out <strong>Reggie Brown</strong>, a third cofounder who was bounced out of the company early on, has done okay, too, having received a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown">$157.5 million settlement </a>after he sued Spiegel and Murphy for his fair share of the business.)</p>

The jury found that cofounder <strong>Palmer Lucky</strong> did not comply with a non-disclosure agreement he had signed; it also said that Oculus did not steal trade secrets, as alleged by ZeniMax in its suit. <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14474198/oculus-lawsuit-verdict">More here</a>.</p>
<h3>Dropcam Cofounder Aamir Virani Joins Felicis</h3>
<p>Last week, we learned that Dropcam cofounder Greg Duffy has headed over <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/dropcams-greg-duffy-joins-apple">to Apple</a>. Today, Felicis Ventures, the early-stage venture firm, is disclosing it has brought aboard Dropcam’s other cofounder, Aamir Virani, as its newest partner.</p>
<p>The move seems a perfect fit for both sides. Felicis wrote one of the earliest checks to Dropcam, an internet-connected security camera company that was sold to Nest Labs in 2014 for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/20/google-and-nest-acquire-dropcam-for-555-million/">$555 million</a>, months after Nest was itself acquired by Google for <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-3-2-billion-purchase-of-nest/">$3.2 billion</a>.</p>
<p>As StrictlyVC reported in <a href="http://www.strictlyvc.com/2014/11/12/unrest-nest/">late 2014</a>, the acquisition proved far from a seamless fit, and by last year, Duffy had <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/3/29/11587344/dropcam-duffy-nest-google-mistake">gone public</a> about his regrets over selling Dropcam to Nest, which he left in 2015.</p>
<p>For his part, however, Virani — who also left Nest in 2015 — stayed mum, calling Google “one of the great companies” of the world during a call earlier this week. Explaining his departure, he said simply that “I wasn’t really a big company person. I just don’t think that mentality is right for me. I like trying to figure out how to make something useful for customers, then figuring out how to create a business that will ensure it survives.”</p>
<p>It largely explains why, over the past year or so, Virani has chosen to do a limited amount of angel investing and to advise a small group of startups, many of them through his network, which includes friends from Rice University, where the Houston native nabbed his undergraduate degree, and Stanford, where he went to grad school.</p>

<h3>Why East Coast Investors are Better Off if the Market Turns</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cooleygo.com/trends/">new trends report</a> published by the law firm Cooley report suggests that the venture market remains largely healthy for now. In the fourth quarter, for example, Cooley handled 187 &#8220;disclosable&#8221; (versus stealth) deals that represented more than $2.7 billion of invested capital. That&#8217;s 18 percent more deals than it closed in the fourth quarter of 2015 &#8212; though the amount of money involved fell 23 percent from the year-earlier period. (VCs were writing smaller checks into a greater number of startups.)</p>
<p>Of slightly more interest to us were the deal terms involved in these fundings, some of which suggest that East Coast VCs have more safeguards than their West Coast peers if the market changes.</p>
<p>We talked with one of the study&#8217;s author, Cooley attorney Dave Young, about what he found and what it might mean.</p>
<p><strong>This report seems pretty positive on its face.</strong></p>
<p>I think it shows a surprisingly strong, healthy venture market. In 2015, there was this sense that maybe things were getting overheated, with nontraditional investors coming in and leading later-stage rounds in companies that hadn’t proven themselves yet. And that led to the view that things would slow down meaningfully in 2016. That didn&#8217;t really happen, though. People were being more disciplined around valuations and the size of rounds, but a lot of deals were getting done.</p>
<p><strong>You also focus on the terms in this report. Are you starting to see anything onerous? </strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;d say founder-friendly terms are still really prevailing, and by that I mean plain vanilla terms. Whenever we inevitably head back to where the economy turns down, terms will get tough, and the levers will shift back toward [investors].</p>
<p><strong>So no pay-to-play provisions [meaning if a company needs to raise money and resorts to insiders for it, those who can’t or don’t want to contribute their pro rata share will see their preferred shares reduced to either common stock or some other subset of equity with fewer rights]. I think there was some expectation that those would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/29/pay-to-play-how-investors-get-burned-fast-in-a-downturn/">start reappearing</a> in deals as this tech boom runs on and on.</strong></p>
<p>We’re seeing some, but it&#8217;s been steady over the last three or four quarters or so, which is a good sign. We&#8217;re seeing them in situations when it makes sense &#8212; when it’s the right tool for that particular situation. But it’s not something people are defaulting to.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes with those down rounds and recaps and pay-to-plays, there&#8217;s a bit of a lag, because if companies are having a hard time getting funded, earlier investors will put in six, nine, 12 months of cash. If you have $10 million in a company already, you&#8217;d rather do that than see it crater. But you only do it once. Without a new lead investor and a new plan, those companies [are going to go out of business].</p>
<p><strong>East Coast investors have historically been a little more metrics-driven than West Coast investors. Is that still true and does that impact how the market could shake out if there&#8217;s a downturn?</strong></p>
<p>This has always been the case, but you see East Coast terms that are way more investor favorable, compared with West Coast [terms]. It&#8217;s more surprising to me that that hasn&#8217;t changed over time.</p>
<p><strong>How do the terms differ, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>In East Coast deals, you see more of what are called redemption provisions and cumulative dividends. Redemption provisions basically give investors the right to be bought out four or five years down the line &#8212; to get their money back if a company joins the living dead. They&#8217;re very rarely seen in Silicon Valley, but they appear in 25 to 30 percent of the deals on the East Coast.</p>

<h3>In Silicon Valley, Plotting to Get Foreign-Born Workers to Vancouver</h3>
<p>For many U.S. startups and their foreign-born employees, a kind of back-up plan may be starting to sound like a good idea right about now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that administration officials have drafted a new executive order aimed at overhauling, among other things, the H-1B work-visa program that U.S.-based tech companies have long relied on to bring top foreign engineering talent into their ranks. Spicer said the possible executive order is “part of a larger immigration effort” related in part to Friday’s hot-button immigration ban targeting immigrants and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim countries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-30/trump-s-next-move-on-immigration-to-hit-closer-to-home-for-tech" target="_blank">According to Bloomberg</a>, the draft proposal states that: “Our country’s immigration policies should be designed and implemented to serve, first and foremost, the U.S. national interest. Visa programs for foreign workers … should be administered in a manner that protects the civil rights of American workers and current lawful residents, and that prioritizes the protection of American workers — our forgotten working people — and the jobs they hold.” (The shorter version: companies have to try hiring U.S.-born employees first.)</p>
<p>Whether and when that executive order gets signed is an open question, but at least one small group of cofounders has banded together to make it easier for U.S. companies to create subsidiaries in Canada and to move their U.S.-based employees to a new, Vancouver-based office, and all within what they describe as weeks, not months. They haven’t created a nonprofit. They’ve instead formed a new company called <a href="https://www.thetruenorth.me/" target="_blank">True North </a>that’s right now offering a $6,000 package that includes airfare for one person to Vancouver, two nights of accommodations, and a day with “world-class immigration professionals who will walk you through the process and answer any questions you have.”</p>
<p>The package is somewhat rich.</p>

					<p>Hi, everyone. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/travelers-detained-nyc-airport-immigration-freeze/">What a weekend</a>. Blergh.</p>
<h3>Top News in the A.M.</h3>
<p>Trump out. Refugees in.&#8221; <strong>Silicon Valley companies</strong> entered the debate over Trump’s immigration policy this weekend, criticizing a new, seven-country immigration ban of people from predominantly Muslim countries and, in some cases, outlining plans to support the employees it affects.</p>
<p>Among the fastest to respond, <strong>Airbnb</strong> offered <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/airbnb-is-offering-free-housing-to-those-turned-away-by-trum?utm_term=.etxyxoxJRP#.ryaXmQmznp">free housing</a> to those who flew into the U.S. Friday night, only to discover they wouldn&#8217;t be allowed on to their destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Sergey Brin</strong>, Google co-founder and president of Alphabet, joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport Saturday night as demonstrators assembled at airports across the country in opposition to the immigration order. Brin told The Verge that he was attending “in a <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/28/14428262/google-sergey-brin">personal capacity</a>” and would not be giving comment. But Forbes’ Ryan Mac separately overheard him saying, “I’m here because I’m a refugee.”</p>
<p>Y Combinator <strong>Sam Altman</strong> was also at the SFO protest, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2017/01/29/y-combinators-sam-altman-this-may-be-a-defining-moment-when-people-oppose-trump/#5740a4221e47">telling Forbes</a>, &#8220;I hope this will be one of the defining moments where people came together against this administration. This is an unacceptable action, and we need to make our voices heard.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong>, the ride-hailing company, also reacted strongly, saying it will be donating <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/29/lyft-donates-1m-to-the-aclu-condemns-trumps-immigration-actions/">$1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union</a> over the next four years. (The ACLU filed suit against Trump’s administration for the refugee ban, and succeeded in getting a temporary stay of the order from a federal judge on Saturday.)</p>
<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, meanwhile, who is now a member of an advisory board that will be meeting quarterly at the White House to talk about manufacturing, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/825502400454594561">tweeted (somewhat dispassionately)</a>, &#8220;The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges.&#8221; (The Archbishop of Chicago agrees, <a href="http://time.com/4652942/chicago-archbishop-donald-trump-immigration-ban/">writing yesterday</a> that the weekend &#8220;proved to be a dark moment in U.S. history&#8221; and that the executive order runs &#8220;contrary to both Catholic and American values.&#8221;)</p>
<p>By yesterday, White House chief of staff <strong>Reince Priebus</strong> appeared to reverse a key part of the immigration order, saying that people from the affected countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/29/us/politics/white-house-official-in-reversal-says-green-card-holders-wont-be-barred.html">who hold green cards</a> will not be prevented from returning to the U.S., but that border agents have “discretionary authority” to detain and question suspicious travelers from certain countries. A number of federal judges across the country also <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-29/trump-immigration-order-blocked-by-boston-federal-judge-too">halted</a> the implementation of the order. According to reports this morning, however, U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees continue to detain people coming into the country.</p>
<p>According to a new Bloomberg report, it could <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-30/trump-s-next-move-on-immigration-to-hit-closer-to-home-for-tech">get worse, too</a>, particularly for high-tech companies. The outlet has reviewed a draft of an executive order aimed at overhauling the work-visa programs they depend on to hire tens of thousands of employees each year.  If implemented, the companies would have to try to hire American first, and if they recruit foreign workers, priority would be given to the most highly paid.</p>
<h3>With Snap&#8217;s IPO Around the Corner, L.A.&#8217;s Amplify Lands New Fund</h3>
<p>L.A. is getting a star turn, with the most iconic of its local startups — <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/">Snap</a> — on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/27/snap-will-reportedly-file-publicly-for-its-massive-ipo-late-next-week/">cusp</a> of going public. Locals expect much more than an endless string of headlines about its IPO performance, too. “The initial performance of the stock will be almost irrelevant,” says Paul Bricault, cofounder of the L.A.-based accelerator and seed-stage venture fund <a href="http://amplify.la/">Amplify</a>. “The IPO will shine a bigger spotlight on L.A. tech, and it will likely spin out more Snap execs as founders of new startups over time —  as well as likely inject more capital into angel funding of startups in L.A.”</p>
<p>Bricault has reason for optimism. Five-year-old Amplify just closed its third fund with $10 million, and it could use new, promising startups  to fund, as well as more capital sloshing around L.A. for follow-on funding. Investing $12.6 million across its first two funds, Amplify has already invested in 50 startups. Fourteen have raised a Series A round, five have raised a Series B round, and ten have subsequently been shut down.</p>
<p>Amplify has nurtured almost all of them at its campus in Venice, Ca., where companies of various, early stages stay for five months on average and are given opportunities to meet with investors for whom they would seem to be a fit. (Rather than stage demo days, Amplify invites investors to its offices four times a year for pre-arranged one-on-one meetings with its portfolio companies.)</p>
<p>On average, the firm, led by Bricault (who is also a venture partner with Greycroft Partners), takes a 10 percent stake in each company in exchange for mentorship, introductions, and initial checks of between $100,000 and $250,000.</p>
<p>Bricault says a proliferation of seed-stage funds is already helping Amplify’s companies attract funding in their “post accelerator round,” but that L.A. is still falling short when it comes to Series A, B, and later rounds.</p>

					<p>Hi, happy Thursday, everyone.:)</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>So <em>that&#8217;s</em> why <strong>Hugo Barra</strong> is coming back to Cali. Yesterday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103456684278791">announced in a post</a> that Barra &#8212; a former executive at Google and, more recently, the Chinese phone maker Xiaomi &#8212; has joined the company to lead its virtual reality business. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/technology/facebook-virtual-reality-hugo-barra.html">More here</a>.</p>
<h2 align="left">Why Silicon Valley is High-Fiving Over Trump&#8217;s SEC Pick</h2>
<p>Wall Street lawyer Walter “Jay” Clayton hasn’t been officially appointed to the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission yet. But given the finite amount of political capital that Democrats wield right now, it’s easy to imagine that he’ll be confirmed and fairly easily when it’s his turn on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>That’s probably welcome news for startup founders and investors who’d seen greater interest in their affairs by the SEC over the last year and will now most likely be left to their own devices.</p>
<p>If haven’t read about him yet, Clayton is the “insider’s insider — a deal maker,” as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/dealbook/donald-trump-sec-jay-clayton.html">Dealbook noted</a> earlier this month, when then President-elect Trump selected him to run the agency. A Washington lawyer at the white-shoe firm <a href="https://www.sullcrom.com/">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</a>, Clayton has spent his career focused on public and private M&amp;A (including advising Goldman Sachs on various acquisitions), capital markets offerings (including working on Alibaba’s 2014 IPO), and enforcement proceedings (including to help clients settle some mortgage related securities claims after the financial crisis of 2008).</p>
<p>What does that background mean for Silicon Valley? Two things, says political strategist and investor Bradley Tusk, who advises startups on how to navigate changing regulations. For starters, Clayton has “some tech experience, which should be appealing to the tech industry,” he says.</p>
<p>Tusk acknowledges that working on the Alibaba IPO isn’t akin to managing the “deal flow you’d see at Wilson Sonsini,” a law firm that has long and famously worked with startups. “But he’s not a total stranger to the sector; he understands its impact on the economy.”</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably, says Tusk, Clayton “isn’t a policy activist. I don’t think this is someone with an ideological view about how security regulation should be expanded.”</p>

<p>So much for the first big tech IPO of the year. As you&#8217;ve likely heard, Cisco has snapped up software developer AppDynamics for $3.7 billion on the eve of its IPO. That stinks for other pre-IPO companies hoping to use it as a weather gage; it&#8217;s great for early investors, given the premium they&#8217;re seeing over the $1.9 billion valuation AppDynamics was assigned in late 2015. Either way, if you&#8217;re wondering what happened, TechCrunch says investment bank Qatalyst Partners &#8212; an M&amp;A specialist &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/why-the-3-7-billion-appdynamics-acquisition-happened-right-before-ipo/">injected itself </a>into the process at the eleventh hour.</p>
<h2 align="left">A Cross-Border Investor Ponders What&#8217;s Next, as U.S.-China Relations Grow Frosty</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to launch a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/23/donald-trump-really-might-start-a-trade-war/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.f257f53e5892">trade war</a> with China, threats that the country is beginning to take <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/asia/trump-us-china-trade-trans-pacific-partnership.html">ever more seriously</a>.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/">GGV Capital</a>, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that’s been actively investing in China for more than 15 years, managing director Hans Tung seems to be watching the jockeying with some wonderment – and patience.</p>
<p>The China native suggests he’s taking his cues from his network, including in Shanghai and Beijing, where GGV has offices. “China isn’t so much concerned with [President Trump yet]; they understand that he can turn right one day and turn left the next to win support. The general thinking is: Let’s see what happens when it comes to actual negotiations. I think the [Chinese government] doesn’t want to overreact in any given moment.”</p>
<p>In a call yesterday, Tung also referred repeatedly to Jack Ma, the founder and CEO of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, a firm that GGV backed in its earlier days. Ma had said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos that China should give Trump some <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/18/jack-ma-trade-war-davos/">time to settle in</a>, adding that a “trade war would be a disaster for the world.”</p>
<p>Ma said he felt so passionately that, given a theoretical choice between keeping his company alive or averting a trade war he would “shut Alibaba down.” (That’s not simple theatrics, seemingly. Ma stated his concerns about a trade war in August, telling CNN, “We should keep on going along the path of globalization. Globalization is good . . . <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/02/technology/jack-ma-alibaba-g20/">when trade stops, war comes</a>.”)</p>
<p>Tung yesterday suggested that China is largely being made a scapegoat by Trump – or sees things that way, in any case. The government “looks at how much the U.S. has spent on wars with Iraq and other things instead of creating jobs and boosting its own capabilities in the Rust Belt. China [will tell you it] never tried to steal jobs. If the U.S had done a better job of reinvesting its money and gotten multinationals to repatriate their money back to the U.S., it would be in much better shape.”</p>
<p>The big question specifically for Tung, who logs hundreds of thousands of miles each year traveling between the two countries, is how suddenly icy relations between the Trump administration and China could impact his own work.</p>
<p>He seems genuinely unconcerned for now.</p>

<h2 align="left">Cowboy Ventures Adds Longtime Attorney Ted Wang as a Partner</h2>
<p>Ted Wang has spent his career helping startups make important decisions, from Facebook, to Twitter, to Dropbox, to Jet. He&#8217;s done it as a partner with the law firm Fenwick &amp; West over the last decade. Now he&#8217;s betting his skills can translate as an investor. Indeed, today, Wang joins the seed-stage venture firm Cowboy Ventures as a full-time investment partner.</p>
<p>Firm cofounder Aileen Lee, who remains Cowboy&#8217;s only general partner, sounded highly enthusiastic about Wang when we chatted about his new appointment yesterday. Lee and Wang met a dozen years ago at an election night party, and they became fast enough friends that they&#8217;ve taken family vacations together, including in Buenos Aires, where Wang and his family were based for some time.</p>
<p>Beyond their friendship, Lee says, Wang has alerted her to companies he has found particularly interesting in the past (including a young Twitter). She has also steered numerous portfolio companies to him owing to his strong track record with startups. (As Wang himself is quick to note, founders are careful in picking both investors as well as lawyers. &#8220;In both cases, the founder is looking for who can help the most and with whom they have have the best chemistry.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Wang also authored Series Seed Documents, a set of open-sourced financing documents posted on Github.</p>
<p>Asked yesterday if Wang thought he was prepared to dive right into investing, or whether there&#8217;s a learning curve to manage first, he laughed. &#8220;I always advise people going in to the industry to take their time. We&#8217;ll see if I can follow my own advice.&#8221;</p>
