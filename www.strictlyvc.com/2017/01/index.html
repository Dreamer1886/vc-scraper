<h2 align="left">Bitcoin Booster Pantera Capital Stays the Course, Targeting a $25M New Fund</h2>
<p>The digital currency bitcoin began 2017 with a bang, soaring to its highest level in more than three years to reach $1,150 – a record high.</p>
<p>Since then, its price has more fallen more the 30 percent as nervous Chinese authorities put local bitcoin exchanges on notice that more regulations may be coming.</p>
<p>To Dan Morehead — a former head of macro trading at Tiger Global who today runs his own San Francisco-based investment firm — such zigs and zags are hardly a surprise. His shop, <a href="https://panteracapital.com/">Pantera Capital</a>, has been exclusively focused on bitcoin and other digital currencies since 2011, and he argues that its price is “actually very predictable.” We talked with him late last week to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin has been going bananas lately. Why?</strong></p>
<p>With the exception of a bubble in 2013, the price is actually very predictable and has been rising along with the actual use of bitcoin. It was [trending up] slowly for a while because Ethereum [an open source public blockchain-based distributed computing platform] was supposed to be <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-co-founder-ethereum-blow-past-bitcoin/">taking over</a> – bitcoin was facing questions over its governance structure – but then Ethereum faded and bitcoin surged back.</p>
<p>That it reached another digit – into a thousand dollars – has gotten people excited, but its price has been grinding up for two years.</p>
<p><strong>How many bitcoins are currently in circulation?</strong></p>
<p>There are 16.09 million bitcoins now, with a roughly $14.4 billion market cap. In a hundred years, there will be 21 million bitcoins. So more than two-thirds of bitcoins have already been issued.</p>
<p>Early on, 50 bitcoins were issued every 10 minutes, then it was 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes, now it’s 12.5 and in another four years it’ll go to 6.25. So as their value is appreciating, the number of bitcoins that are being issued is being cut in half. The total value is going up fast as a result.</p>
<p><strong>Where do those 16 million bitcoins mostly reside?</strong></p>
<p>There’s no solid data on this, but anecdotally, it’s extremely popular in China because a lot of the transaction processors – or bitcoin miners — are there as chip manufacturing is there and electricity is inexpensive because of big hydro plans. Also, with Chinese currency devaluing and speculation that the country’s banking system is suspect or bankrupt, it’s a great way for citizens to store their wealth; some see it as a safer depository institution than their bank.</p>
<p><strong>Why would anyone ever use the currency, versus merely hold it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s definitely enticing for an investor to hold bitcoin, because they can buy more assets in the future. We have a fund where we’re investing in digital currency startups, but we have another where we invest in the currency and just hold it because we think it’ll be more valuable in the future.</p>
<p><strong>How much bitcoin has that second fund of yours amassed?</strong></p>

					<p>Hi, happy Wednesday, everyone! Know we&#8217;re a little late &#8212; we&#8217;re still trying to recover from that press conference this morning.</p>

<h2 align="left">Precursor Ventures Raises $15.3 Million for Seed Investing, with a Twist</h2>
<p>Charles Hudson has lived in the Bay Area for the last 20 years, working as product manager, as an entrepreneur, and an investor. As such, he’s had a front row seat to a number of changes in the way that startup are funding, including the evolution of numerous angel investors into so-called micro VCs into fund managers who are now responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Take investor Jeff Clavier, who began sprinkling tiny amounts of money across what appeared to be a new crop of capital-efficient startups back in 2004 and soon after launched a firm, SoftTechVC, where Hudson would become a partner in 2013. By 2014, SoftTech had closed a fourth fund with $85 million. Last June, it closed on a record $150 million across two funds.</p>
<p>Hudson was cheering on the firm &#8212; from down the street in San Francisco. Since last year, he has been creating his own brand, Precursor Ventures, to seize on the funding vacuum creating by firms like SoftTech that can no longer write small checks. Hudson, one of few African American VCs in the Bay Area, also sees another underserved opportunity in funding women and other minorities.</p>
<p>We talked with Hudson last week about how he&#8217;s approaching both missions and whether they were a difficult, or easy, sell for Precursor&#8217;s investors, who&#8217;ve given the company $15.3 million for its first fund.</p>
<p><strong>Why strike out on your own with a new fund?</strong></p>
<p>The big observation for me was that all the micro VC funds are really big now and they&#8217;ve stopped doing classic seed-stage funding. The goal for Precursor is to write checks in the range of $150,000 to $250,000 to teams that have maybe two founders and a prototype and probably not much in the way of a launched product or traction, with about 20 percent of the capital set aside to participate in [slightly more mature] companies that are maybe raising $2 million on a $6 million [pre-money] valuation.</p>
<p><strong>How many companies do you think you can support with this new fund?</strong></p>
<p>The idea is to write 18 to 20 checks per year, so I&#8217;ve made 50 investments over the last two years, including [as I was raising this fund].</p>
<p><strong>And investors didn&#8217;t think that was too much, that you were spreading your investments too thin? Why not go in the exact opposite direction and make lesser, more concentrated bets?</strong></p>
<p>For one thing, because there is so little institutional capital at the pre-seed stage, I felt like I could be more aggressive. Also, because of the rising cost of doing business in San Francisco, and because a lot of the founders I back don&#8217;t need to be here, I&#8217;ve encouraged many of them to stay where they are &#8212; in Tampa and Raleigh and Charleston and Baltimore. And it&#8217;s pretty cool to see how much more capital efficient they can be in these regions with $150,000 to $250,0000 in backing.</p>
<p><strong>Are you leading most of these rounds?</strong></p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d lead, but we do lead a lot, because without us, these rounds don&#8217;t come together. It&#8217;s sort of like, everyone is in for $25,000, but no one wants to issue terms. Believing in people early and being able to issue terms helps rounds come together.</p>

<h2 align="left">That Strange New Lawsuit Against Investor Michael Goguen was Just Dropped</h2>
<p>Early <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/06/1424852/">last month</a>, we told you about a bizarre new lawsuit involving longtime venture capitalist Michael Goguen, whose long career at Sequoia Capital ended early last year after he was sued in a salacious <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/304104968/Goguen-Baptiste-San-Mateo-Court?content=10079&amp;ad_group=Online+Tracking+Link&amp;campaign=Skimbit%2C+Ltd.&amp;keyword=ft500noi&amp;source=impactradius&amp;medium=affiliate&amp;irgwc=1">breach of contract</a> suit that accused him of sexually mistreating a woman named Amber Baptiste, then refusing to honor an elaborate financial arrangement they’d made.</p>
<p>Baptiste and Goguen are set to meet in court this coming May. But the newer suit, filed the first week of December by a former acquaintance named Bryan Nash, was just dropped — and not surprisingly given the circumstances.</p>
<p>According to Nash’s suit, he first met Goguen in 1994 and they became “friends.” As Nash and Goguen’s “friendship developed,” they enjoyed “joint family gatherings,” took “vacations together,” went “mountain biking together,” and also exercised together, it said.</p>
<p>After skipping over two decades (that&#8217;s not an exaggeration), Nash&#8217;s suit proceeded to claim that last year, Goguen agreed to pay Nash $15 million &#8212; and an eventual $19 million altogether &#8212; for &#8220;unrelated professional and personal assistance to Goguen.&#8221; The issue at the crux of the suit was that “before the funds were deposited through the wire transfer,” Goguen then &#8220;withheld, or revoked” the transfer.</p>
<p>None of Nash’s complaint added up, as you’ve probably surmised yourself, but that didn’t stop a Mission Viejo, Ca.-based <a href="http://www.rjmlawfirm.com/">personal injury law firm</a> from agreeing to represent Nash in his lawsuit.</p>
<p>At least, until yesterday.</p>

<h2 align="left">A Startup that Makes Every Day a Payday Just Raised a $22M Series A</h2>
<p>What if you didn’t have to wait every two weeks to receive a paycheck?</p>
<p>What if you could be wired the money you earned almost immediately after a shift?</p>
<p>What if, unlike with payday lenders, you didn’t have to pay interest on those payments? Instead, you were merely encouraged to donate a kind of tip to the company providing you with this service?</p>
<p>That’s the proposition of <a href="https://www.activehours.com/">Activehours</a>, a four-year-old, Palo Alto, Ca.-based financial services startup that aims to turn the payroll process on its head — and which just raised $22 million in Series A funding toward that end, led by Matrix Partners.</p>
<p>The company basically serves as kind of ATM, letting consumers who’ve accrued earnings pay for transactions like an unexpected car repair or an overdue bill without being charged onerous overdraft fees from their bank or else a high-interest payday lender. Activehours doesn’t charge interest, either, but rather invites people to provide it with a non-obligatory tip that they think is fair for the service.</p>
<p>Activehours doesn’t take into consideration a person’s credit history. It doesn’t ask for a social security number. Anyone who has a checking account and a job can use the service, regardless of their employer, though Activehours has <a href="http://www.retaildive.com/news/sears-activehours-team-to-give-shop-your-way-members-store-associates-pay/430391/">struck partnerships</a> with companies, including Sears Holdings (which owns Sears and Kmart), to make it easier for its employees to access their accrued pay before their paychecks arrive. The company also also teamed up with Uber, whose drivers need only connect their bank information and Uber account information with Activehours in order to cash out after a shift.</p>
<p>In another interesting twist, anyone on the platform can also “tip” on behalf of someone else on the platform, an act that’s done entirely anonymously. Think of it like paying a toll booth operator for your own car, as well as for the car that’s behind you.)</p>
<p>“This is a service for the barista, or the person working in bookstore, or a teller at a bank,” says Matrix general partner Dana Stalder who led the deal for his firm. “It is the 50 percent of [the U.S. population] that has revolving debt on their credit cards — plus another big cross section of those who don’t.”</p>
<p>But no fees? No interest? How can this possibly work as a business, especially as the company scales?</p>

<h2 align="left">The Billion Dollar Pharma Startup That Silicon Valley Totally Missed</h2>
<p>When it comes to millennials and health care companies, recent history gives plenty of reason for pause. Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of Theranos, has watched her star fall precipitously over the last year, amid a continuing drumbeat of allegations that her blood testing company <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/11/explosive-new-details-emerge-in-lawsuit-against-theranos">never worked as advertised</a>. Meanwhile, Martin Shkreli, a young hedge fund manager turned pharmaceutical executive, was for a while the country’s <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2016/09/27/heres-how-to-punch-martin-shkreli-in-the-face/#658715b722c1">most reviled</a> businessperson, after his relatively small company, Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought a drug that treats toxoplasmosis, and promptly raised its price from less than $20 per tablet to $750.</p>
<p>If these black marks on the industry are slowing down 31-year-old Vivek Ramaswamy in any way, you wouldn’t know it. He thinks his company, <a href="http://roivant.com/">Roivant</a>, will one day be a giant holding company for dozens of independent biopharmaceutical companies – both by developing drugs as well as focusing squarely on reducing the time and cost of the drug development process.</p>
<p>It all sounds rather lofty. Then again, it’s hard to argue why Ramaswamy <em>shouldn’t</em> be the one to reshape how drugs are brought to market.</p>
<p>A Cincinnati native who studied biology at Harvard then earned a law degree from Yale, it was when Ramaswamy began working as an analyst in 2007 at the hedge fund <a href="http://www.qvt.com/files/approach.html">QVT Financial</a> in New York that he first observed the problem that defines his work today. What he noticed: that many big and small pharmaceutical firms abandon promising drugs for various reasons having nothing to do with their efficacy. Sometimes, it’s a strategic decision to focus elsewhere; sometimes, it owes to a lack of resources. Seeing an opportunity to complete the development of some of these abandoned late-stage drug candidates and get them to market quickly, Ramaswamy struck out on his own in 2014.</p>
<p>Having earned the trust of QVT was key. The firm, along with <a href="http://www.dexcel.com/">Dexcel Pharma</a>, an Israeli firm that reviewed Ramaswamy’s work at QVT, provided Ramaswamy’s new holding company with just less than $100 million in capital – a feat, given that he was just 28 years old at the time.</p>
<p>Yet what Ramaswamy has done with Roivant in the years since is pretty remarkable, too.</p>
<p>While Silicon Valley has obsessed over Theranos, Ramaswamy has acquired a dozen drugs, including an Alzheimer’s pill that’s named, for now, RVT-101. He also formed a company around that drug, <a href="http://axovant.com/">Axovant Science</a>, and took it public in 2015 – despite that the drug’s Phase 3 results won’t be out until this year.</p>
<p>It became the <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/11/biggest-biotech-ipo-ever-and-the-ceo-is-29.html">biggest biotech IPO ever</a> in the U.S., raising $360 million. It has largely held up, too. Axovant’s shares, which opened at $15, currently trade around $13.25.</p>
<p>Roivant has also launched <a href="http://www.enzyvant.com/">Enzyvant Sciences</a>, a company focused on rare genetic pediatric conditions that Ramaswamy calls “ignored and underserved, ” including a metabolic disorder called Farber disease and DiGeorge syndrome, a genetic disease that results in poor development of several body systems.</p>
<p>Roivant has also teamed up with one of Japan’s oldest companies, Takeda Pharmaceuticals to start <a href="http://myovant.com/">Myovant Sciences</a>, a standalone company that’s focused on women’s health issues. The drug candidate around which the company is centered is called Relugolix, which aims to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Takeda is currently conducting two Phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stitchfix.com/">Stitch Fix</a>, <a href="https://www.trunkclub.com/">Trunk Club</a>, and other subscription e-commerce businesses have made it easier for adults to discover clothing they like without having to trundle through department stores. Users sign up for the services, which survey them about their likes, dislikes, preferred brands and price points, then they begin receiving pre-scheduled or on-demand deliveries of clothes that they can either keep or return.</p>
<p>The services ostensibly grow smarter the longer the consumer uses the service. They also appeal to parents, who want the same easy shopping experience when it comes to outfitting their kids. So suggests $12.5 million in new funding for <a href="https://www.rocketsofawesome.com/">Rockets of Awesome</a>, a year-old, New York-based subscription service that sends 12 pieces of clothing per child to its customers at the start of each season and that charges parents only for what they keep. (Returns are free and the company says it learns from them to improve its customers’ experience.)</p>
<p>The new round was led by August Capital, with participation from earlier backers General Catalyst Partners and Forerunner Ventures, which had previously provided the company with $7 million in seed funding, along with Female Founders Fund and Launch Incubator.</p>
<p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who recently wrote a check to another newish retail brand backed by General Catalyst called <a href="https://www.outdoorvoices.com/">Outdoor Voices</a>, also joined the round.</p>
<p>Rockets of Awesome isn’t an exact replica of its adult-centric predecessors. Most significantly, it isn’t acting as a personal shopper. Instead of sending brands to parents that they (or their kids) like, the company makes it own apparel.</p>
