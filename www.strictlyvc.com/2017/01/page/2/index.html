					<p>Hi, guys, happy Wednesday! We&#8217;re going to trying to keep things short and sweet today so we can do, you know, holiday stuff. We&#8217;re guessing you&#8217;re with us on this. More tomorrow.:)</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>The <strong>House Judiciary Committee’s Encryption Working Group</strong> has released its year-end report, and it concludes that law enforcement <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14032864/congress-encryption-working-group-report-backdoor">backdoors pose a threat to security</a>.</p>
<h2 align="left">Things Get Down and Dirty in the World of Cloud Security</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.symantec.com/">Symantec</a>, one of the world’s largest cybersecurity companies, closed its giant acquisition of Blue Coat Systems in <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/security/300081535/symantec-closes-acquisition-of-blue-coat-looks-to-begin-product-integration-strategy.htm?itc=hp_todays_news">August</a>, ushering in a new regime under incoming CEO Greg Clark.</p>
<p>Clark hasn’t wasted much time in disparaging upstarts in the market, either, including the well-funded, venture-backed companies <a href="https://www.cylance.com/">Cylance</a>, <a href="https://www.tanium.com/">Tanium</a> and <a href="http://www.carbonblack.com/">Carbon Black</a>.</p>
<p>Now, lawsuits may be next. To wit, Symantec last week filed a lawsuit against one of its partners, <a href="https://www.zscaler.com/">Zscaler</a>, saying the cloud security vendor has infringed on seven of its patents, including around web security and threat prevention.</p>
<p>Symantec didn’t inform Zscaler about the suit in advance of going public with it, evidently. In a <a href="http://www.crn.com/news/security/300083135/symantec-sues-it-cloud-security-vendor-zscaler-for-patent-infringement.htm">statement last week</a> to the outlet CRN, Zscaler’s chief legal officer said Zscaler “learned of Symantec’s lawsuit from their press release issued earlier this afternoon and [we] are in the very early stages of assessing their claims. While we are unable to comment on the merits of their claims at this time, we defend ourselves vigorously against lawsuits of this nature.”</p>
<p>Zscaler has since begun reaching out individually to customers to tell them the suit is little more than a bullying tactic that won’t impact its business, shows a letter authored by Zcaler CEO Jay Chaudhry and obtained by this editor earlier today. The nine-year-old company declined to comment on the letter or when, exactly, it was authored, but it reads:</p>
<p><em>Dear Robert,</em></p>
<p><em>You may have heard about the lawsuit recently filed by Symantec against Zscaler. Zscaler will defend itself vigorously against these claims.</em></p>
<p><em>Zscaler was founded to transform the old world of IT to a cloud-enabled enterprise, from the world of on-premise security appliances to cloud-based multi-tenant Internet gateways. When our customers and partners think of Zscaler, the first thing that comes to their mind is technology innovation. Our innovations are protected by a large growing portfolio of 98 issued and pending patents focused on cloud security.</em></p>
<p><em>It is unfortunate that many large incumbent companies will resort to litigation when they can no longer innovate. They attempt to use it to hinder rapid growth and customer adoption of unique technologies offered by younger, vibrant companies like Zscaler. In certain situations, as is the case here, the incumbent companies make such claims without any advance notice.</em></p>

<p>Good news for the <strong>Honest Company</strong>: the Los Angeles Superior Court has dismissed a six-month-old suit filed against the company by the industry nonprofit Organic Consumers Association, which alleged that Honest’s infant formula was falsely labeled as organic. The judgement determined that if anyone is to blame, it’s the federal government, which certified that the product could be labeled as organic. Forbes has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2016/12/19/court-dismisses-honest-co-baby-formula-suit-as-organic-group-files-appeal/#1eacbecc101e">more here</a>.</p>
<h2 align="left">TPG is Raising $2 Billion for a Social Impact Fund Called Rise</h2>
<p>Bill McGlashan, who oversees <a href="http://www.tpg.com/platforms/tpggrowth">TPG Growth</a> — the growth investing platform of the global firm TPG — is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/19/business/dealbook/a-new-fund-seeks-both-financial-and-social-returns.html">reportedly fundraising</a> right now for a $2 billion vehicle called Rise that will seek both financial and social returns.</p>
<p>He tells Dealbook the fund was inspired by bets TPG Growth has already made, including in a cellphone tower company in Myanmar called <a href="https://apollo-towers.com/">Apollo Towers</a> that helped the country progress from zero cellphone penetration to roughly 70 percent, which has translated into 5 percent G.D.P. growth — as well as doubled the value of TPG’s investment.</p>
<p>McGlashan has enlisted some high-wattage names as board members in order to help sway investors. Among them, says Dealbook: Bono; eBay founder Pierre Omidyar; Jeff Skoll, who served as the first president of eBay; Laurene Powell Jobs; Richard Branson; Reid Hoffman; Mellody Hobson, president of Ariel Investments; philanthropist Lynne Benioff; and investor Mo Ibrahim.</p>
<p>According to the report, so far, “at least two large pension funds and one sovereign wealth fund have committed nine figure sums.”</p>
<p>McGlashan has led TPG Growth since 2003. The unit, within 23-year-old TPG Capital, had begun life with a $500 million venture fund in 1999. (At the time, it was one of the largest-ever first time funds.) Then the market famously crashed, and McGlashan was brought in to head up a new, growth-fund strategy.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.strictlyvc.com/2015/05/01/tpg-growths-bill-mcglashan-were-no-stranger-to-startups/">chat with StrictlyVC</a> last year, McGlashan noted that TPG Growth now invests typically in between 10 and 15 companies each year where it can accelerate the business.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Apple CEO <strong>Tim Cook</strong> took to the company&#8217;s internal messaging system to tell employees why he met with Trump last week at that lil&#8217; tech summit. Writes Cook: “Personally, I’ve never found being on the sideline a successful place to be. The way that you influence these issues is to be in the arena. So whether it’s in this country, or the European Union, or in China or South America, we engage. And we engage when we agree and we engage when we disagree. I think it’s very important to do that because you don’t change things by just yelling. You change things by showing everyone why your way is the best.” TechCrunch has much <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/19/tim-cook-explains-to-apple-employees-why-he-met-with-president-elect-trump/">more here</a>.</p>

<h2 align="left">NextView Looks to Fund Three</h2>
<p><a href="http://nextviewventures.com/">NextView Ventures</a>, one of few seed-stage venture firms in Boston, is looking to raise at least $50 million for a third fund, shows an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1692145/000169214516000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> that was processed Wednesday. The firm closed its second fund with $40 million in 2014 and its debut fund with $21 million in 2012.</p>
<p>NextView was founded in 2010 by three former veterans of other venture firms: Dave Beisel, who’d previously worked for Venrock; Rob Go, who was formerly with Spark Capital; and Lee Hower, a former investor with Judith Capital.</p>
<p>They’ve seemingly worked hard to raise the profile of the firm over that period, too. Go, for example, posts two or three pieces of analysis or advice each month to his widely read <a href="http://robgo.org/">blog</a>. (One of his most recent posts compares the process of sourcing venture deals to the process of drumming up customers for a software company, including nurturing leads over an extended period.)</p>
<p>The firm typically writes checks of between $100,000 and $1 million. Some of its newest investments include <a href="https://gethuman.com/">GetHuman</a>, a four-year-old, Boston-based startup that fights people’s customer service battles for them (NextView led a <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2016/11/07/gethuman-arms-itself-with-3m-to-fight-customer-service-battles/">$3 million</a> seed round in the company last month), and <a href="http://optimusride.com/">Optimus Ride</a>, an MIT spinoff at work on self-driving technologies. NextView led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/11/self-driving-tech-startup-optimus-ride-raises-5-25m-seed-round/">$5.25 million</a> seed round in the company in October.</p>
<p>At least 13 of NextView’s portfolio companies have been acquired, shows Crunchbase data.</p>
