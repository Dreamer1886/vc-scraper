					<p>Hi, happy Thursday, everyone.:)</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>So <em>that&#8217;s</em> why <strong>Hugo Barra</strong> is coming back to Cali. Yesterday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103456684278791">announced in a post</a> that Barra &#8212; a former executive at Google and, more recently, the Chinese phone maker Xiaomi &#8212; has joined the company to lead its virtual reality business. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/technology/facebook-virtual-reality-hugo-barra.html">More here</a>.</p>
<h2 align="left">Why Silicon Valley is High-Fiving Over Trump&#8217;s SEC Pick</h2>
<p>Wall Street lawyer Walter “Jay” Clayton hasn’t been officially appointed to the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission yet. But given the finite amount of political capital that Democrats wield right now, it’s easy to imagine that he’ll be confirmed and fairly easily when it’s his turn on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>That’s probably welcome news for startup founders and investors who’d seen greater interest in their affairs by the SEC over the last year and will now most likely be left to their own devices.</p>
<p>If haven’t read about him yet, Clayton is the “insider’s insider — a deal maker,” as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/dealbook/donald-trump-sec-jay-clayton.html">Dealbook noted</a> earlier this month, when then President-elect Trump selected him to run the agency. A Washington lawyer at the white-shoe firm <a href="https://www.sullcrom.com/">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</a>, Clayton has spent his career focused on public and private M&amp;A (including advising Goldman Sachs on various acquisitions), capital markets offerings (including working on Alibaba’s 2014 IPO), and enforcement proceedings (including to help clients settle some mortgage related securities claims after the financial crisis of 2008).</p>
<p>What does that background mean for Silicon Valley? Two things, says political strategist and investor Bradley Tusk, who advises startups on how to navigate changing regulations. For starters, Clayton has “some tech experience, which should be appealing to the tech industry,” he says.</p>
<p>Tusk acknowledges that working on the Alibaba IPO isn’t akin to managing the “deal flow you’d see at Wilson Sonsini,” a law firm that has long and famously worked with startups. “But he’s not a total stranger to the sector; he understands its impact on the economy.”</p>
<p>Perhaps more notably, says Tusk, Clayton “isn’t a policy activist. I don’t think this is someone with an ideological view about how security regulation should be expanded.”</p>

That stinks for other pre-IPO companies hoping to use it as a weather gage; it&#8217;s great for early investors, given the premium they&#8217;re seeing over the $1.9 billion valuation AppDynamics was assigned in late 2015. Either way, if you&#8217;re wondering what happened, TechCrunch says investment bank Qatalyst Partners &#8212; an M&amp;A specialist &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/why-the-3-7-billion-appdynamics-acquisition-happened-right-before-ipo/">injected itself </a>into the process at the eleventh hour.</p>
<h2 align="left">A Cross-Border Investor Ponders What&#8217;s Next, as U.S.-China Relations Grow Frosty</h2>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to launch a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/23/donald-trump-really-might-start-a-trade-war/?tid=a_inl&amp;utm_term=.f257f53e5892">trade war</a> with China, threats that the country is beginning to take <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/world/asia/trump-us-china-trade-trans-pacific-partnership.html">ever more seriously</a>.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/">GGV Capital</a>, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that’s been actively investing in China for more than 15 years, managing director Hans Tung seems to be watching the jockeying with some wonderment – and patience.</p>
<p>The China native suggests he’s taking his cues from his network, including in Shanghai and Beijing, where GGV has offices. “China isn’t so much concerned with [President Trump yet]; they understand that he can turn right one day and turn left the next to win support. The general thinking is: Let’s see what happens when it comes to actual negotiations. I think the [Chinese government] doesn’t want to overreact in any given moment.”</p>
<p>In a call yesterday, Tung also referred repeatedly to Jack Ma, the founder and CEO of the e-commerce giant Alibaba, a firm that GGV backed in its earlier days. Ma had said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos that China should give Trump some <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/18/jack-ma-trade-war-davos/">time to settle in</a>, adding that a “trade war would be a disaster for the world.”</p>
<p>Ma said he felt so passionately that, given a theoretical choice between keeping his company alive or averting a trade war he would “shut Alibaba down.” (That’s not simple theatrics, seemingly. Ma stated his concerns about a trade war in August, telling CNN, “We should keep on going along the path of globalization. Globalization is good . . . <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/02/technology/jack-ma-alibaba-g20/">when trade stops, war comes</a>.”)</p>
<p>Tung yesterday suggested that China is largely being made a scapegoat by Trump – or sees things that way, in any case. The government “looks at how much the U.S. has spent on wars with Iraq and other things instead of creating jobs and boosting its own capabilities in the Rust Belt. China [will tell you it] never tried to steal jobs. If the U.S had done a better job of reinvesting its money and gotten multinationals to repatriate their money back to the U.S., it would be in much better shape.”</p>
<p>The big question specifically for Tung, who logs hundreds of thousands of miles each year traveling between the two countries, is how suddenly icy relations between the Trump administration and China could impact his own work.</p>
<p>He seems genuinely unconcerned for now.</p>

					<p>Hi, happy Tuesday, everyone!</p>

<h2 align="left">Cowboy Ventures Adds Longtime Attorney Ted Wang as a Partner</h2>
<p>Ted Wang has spent his career helping startups make important decisions, from Facebook, to Twitter, to Dropbox, to Jet. He&#8217;s done it as a partner with the law firm Fenwick &amp; West over the last decade. Now he&#8217;s betting his skills can translate as an investor. Indeed, today, Wang joins the seed-stage venture firm Cowboy Ventures as a full-time investment partner.</p>
<p>Firm cofounder Aileen Lee, who remains Cowboy&#8217;s only general partner, sounded highly enthusiastic about Wang when we chatted about his new appointment yesterday. Lee and Wang met a dozen years ago at an election night party, and they became fast enough friends that they&#8217;ve taken family vacations together, including in Buenos Aires, where Wang and his family were based for some time.</p>
<p>Beyond their friendship, Lee says, Wang has alerted her to companies he has found particularly interesting in the past (including a young Twitter). She has also steered numerous portfolio companies to him owing to his strong track record with startups. (As Wang himself is quick to note, founders are careful in picking both investors as well as lawyers. &#8220;In both cases, the founder is looking for who can help the most and with whom they have have the best chemistry.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Wang also authored Series Seed Documents, a set of open-sourced financing documents posted on Github.</p>
<p>Asked yesterday if Wang thought he was prepared to dive right into investing, or whether there&#8217;s a learning curve to manage first, he laughed. &#8220;I always advise people going in to the industry to take their time. We&#8217;ll see if I can follow my own advice.&#8221;</p>

<h2 align="left">Mithril, Led by Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan, Closes New Fund with Roughly $850M</h2>
<p>Peter Thiel being suddenly cast into the center of U.S. politics in 2016 isn’t something that either Thiel or his longtime friend and colleague Ajay Royan could have anticipated in 2014, when they founded Mithril Capital Management. But it doesn’t change much for the low-flying, 12-person firm, which is based in San Francisco but makes outsize bets on companies that are largely outside of the Bay Area.</p>
<p>In fact, Royan insists that Thiel’s position on President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team had no discernible impact on fundraising for its second and newest fund, which the firm just closed with $850 million, including management fees.</p>
<p>“It’s been interesting,” Royan says of Trump’s divisive win. “As observers, we’re fascinated by what’s going on; there seem to be a lot of issues that are conflated by social media and so forth. But on a day-to-day basis, what we think about and what we do hasn’t changed at all. Maybe if we were more Silicon Valley focused, we might feel it more. My social media feed is more activated around the [election results] than my business relationships.”</p>
<p>Some of those business relationships center on Mithril’s investors, mostly family offices in the U.S., Europe and Canada and limited enough in number than Royan spends a couple of hours with each every quarter, rather than host a formal annual meeting.</p>
<p>“Having a small base allows you to give people individual updates,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We can talk about the fullness of their business and the fullness of our business.”</p>
<p>They have plenty to discuss, surely. Mithril, which closed its first fund with roughly $540 million, has now invested in 22 companies, including the data analytics company Palantir, cofounded by Thiel; C2FO, a nine-year-old, Kansas City-based collaborative cash-flow optimization company that tries unlocking capital trapped in trade relationships; Adimab, a 10-year-old, Lebanon, New Hampshire-based antibody drug discovery startup; and a nine-year-old, Redwood City, Ca.-based surgical robotics company called Auris Surgical Robotics, whose founder Royan gleefully describes as having the “energy of 99 founders.”</p>
<p>(That founder, Dr. Frederic Moll, has cofounded several companies previously, including Intuitive Surgical, a 20-year-old, publicly traded company that makes robotic surgical systems and is valued at $25 billion.)</p>
<p>Mithil doesn’t have any exits to speak of yet, but investors sign up for a portfolio that’s fairly concentrated. Its debut fund committed $100 million to one (undisclosed) company, for example, and its median check size is $50 million. (Royan says that Adimab has now received more investment from Mithril than any other company it has funded. Wired profiled it <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/03/mutant-yeast-cranking-pharmas-next-superdrug/">last year</a>.)</p>
<p>Investors also agree to a longer-than-usual ride with Mithril, whose funds have 12-year-long investing periods, giving Royan and Thiel the flexibility to make bets in established companies that aren’t yet ready to go public.</p>
<p>For example, C2FO is now clearing a billion dollars in transaction volume every day, up from a billion dollars every quarter in 2014, when Mithril invested in the company. Yet asked if an IPO is in sight for 2017, Royan says C2FO has no plans to go public yet and that he generally believes there should be a “line of sight to saturation” before an outfit starts talking with investment bankers.</p>
<p>“You want the public markets to have the confidence that yours in the last company in its category that they need to be thinking about,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>Royan also holds up C2FO as the kind of company that Mithril pursues in part because it’s outside of Silicon Valley. “I love that I have to be in Kanas City five times a year,&#8221; he says, speaking from Mithril&#8217;s sleek offices in the leafy Presidio, a former military base turned national park.</p>
<p>Kansas, he says, is among many places where individuals, including founders, can have a very different perspective and life experience than that of the &#8220;top-notch MIT grad or Stanford grad who lives in San Francisco or a place that consciously or unconsciously looks like it, including parts of Boston, large parts of New York &#8212; even Berlin, Stockholm and London, which very much have a Silicon Valley state of mind.”</p>
<p>I ask Royan if, as Thiel has suggested, he thinks Silicon Valley &#8212; where Mithril has funded seven companies altogether &#8212; has become too disconnected from the rest of the country.</p>

<h2 align="left">Facebook Agreed to Pay More for Oculus Than We Realized; Here&#8217;s Why</h2>
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a Dallas court yesterday as part of a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-palmer-luckey-to-testify-in-2-billion-zenimax-lawsuit-against-oculus-vr-2017-1">lawsuit</a> claiming that Oculus VR, the startup Facebook acquired for roughly $2 billion, was based on stolen technology. Unsurprisingly, Zuckerberg defended Oculus and in the process revealed a number of new details about the negotiations involved in purchasing the company. Among them: that Facebook agreed to pay <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/821372823499403264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$700 million</a> in employee retention bonuses for &#8220;key people.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was news to the rest of us. When Facebook <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/03/facebook-to-acquire-oculus/">announced the deal</a> back in 2014, it said it was paying a &#8220;total of approximately&#8221; $2 billion, including $400 million in cash and  23.1 million shares of Facebook. It said the agreement &#8220;also provides for an additional $300 million earn-out in cash and stock&#8221; based on Oculus meeting certain milestones. It said bupkis about that extra $700 million in retention bonuses.</p>
<p>Was its own release &#8220;<a href="http://mashable.com/2017/01/17/facebook-oculus-price/#NKH1WR0r2kqu">fake news</a>?&#8221; It&#8217;s commonly known that the actual price paid for a company and what the public sees in headlines is rarely the same, owing to factors like the fluctuating value of an acquirer&#8217;s stock. But a $700 million difference? Isn&#8217;t that notable?</p>
<p>Actually, no, said a handful of bankers and analysts with whom we spoke yesterday. Here&#8217;s why. That original press release from Facebook addressed the price paid for Oculus to its former owners (including its founders, Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, and Spark Capital, among others). That&#8217;s the $2 billion, plus that $300 million earn-out component.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the $700 million that Zuckerberg referenced yesterday takes into account the ongoing costs following the close of the deal, and those costs &#8212; in the form of employee incentives &#8212; aren&#8217;t typically considered in the purchase price as they&#8217;re paid out over time, as one co-chair of a corporate securities group told us.</p>
<p>In short, new employees have to work for that money.</p>
<p>Tom Peters, cofounder of the San Francisco-based investment bank Iverness Advisors, agrees with that view. As a former managing director at Montgomery &amp; Co., Peters worked on the sale of MySpace to News Corp. in 2005, and says that while the deal is referred to this day as costing <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/murdoch-says-580-million-myspace-buy-a-huge-mistake-2011-10">$580 million</a>, it was really $630 million by the time every i was dotted and t was crossed. &#8220;The devil is always in the details,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>When it comes to this particular disparity, while it may seem &#8220;shockingly big,&#8221; he says the money that was set aside for compensation to certain Oculus employees for continuing to work at Facebook must have been separated out from purchase price, which is a &#8220;not uncommon&#8221; practice, he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s often viewed as in a different category, including because of accounting guidelines that tell you to account for things in different ways.&#8221; (He notes, for example, that tax treatments and tax consequences differ when it comes to purchase prices versus compensation.)</p>
<p>In the end, &#8220;it was a judgment call,&#8221; says a San Francisco-based investment banker who asked not to be named. &#8220;Certainly, Facebook could have mentioned the possibility of additional payments at the time of the acquisition. Then again, does it want to be known for paying big retention bonuses and earn-outs? You can see the case [for leaving out that information].&#8221;</p>

<h2 align="left">Joe Lonsdale Moves Forward with 8VC&#8217;s New Fund and More</h2>
<p>Joe Lonsdale has had his fair share of ups and downs in recent years. Investors don’t seem to mind. Nearly a year ago, they quietly provided Lonsdale’s newest, early-stage venture firm, <a href="http://8vc.com/">8VC</a>, with $425 million in funding for its debut fund, along with $50 million for a separate seed fund. The firm, which is run by five partners, has since invested a quarter of that capital in an array of companies, including, most recently, Synthego, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/04/business/dealbook/synthego-raises-41-million-from-investors-including-a-top-biochemist.html?_r=0">genetic engineering startup</a> that provides scientists with genetic material used in their Crispr research.</p>
<p>Lonsdale declined to comment on 8VC’s fundraising last year. But last week, we spoke with him about the new fund and, to a much lesser extent, about Formation 8 Partners, which Lonsdale <a href="http://fortune.com/2013/04/11/the-hottest-vcs-since-andreessen/">famously cofounded</a> in 2011 with Stanford classmate Brian Koo and longtime venture investor Jim Kim before the three <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/10/what-caused-formation-8-to-split-and-what-comes-next/">abruptly disbanded</a> in 2015. One oft-cited reason for the firm’s demise: differing opinions about strategy.</p>
<p>Koo has since founded another firm: <a href="http://formationgroup.com/">Formation Group</a>, which hews most closely to Formation 8’s mission, which was to bridge the ecosystems between Asian countries and Silicon Valley. Kim has also cofounded a new venture firm called <a href="http://builders.vc/">Builders</a>, which we reported on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/09/formation-8-founder-jim-kim-and-longtime-vc-paul-lee-partner-on-a-new-fund-called-builders/">last month</a>. Its big idea: to help nascent companies gets sales and marketing staff involved early.</p>
<p>8VC’s mantra is simply, “The world is broken; let’s fix it.”</p>
<p>That approach helps explain its bet on Synthego. It also accounts for a perhaps more controversial bet on <a href="https://hyperloop-one.com/">Hyperloop One</a>, an ambitious company aiming to build faster, cleaner long-distance travel through a supersonic transit system that remains largely theoretical for now. (The <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/10/25/hyperloop-one-seeks-new-cash-amid-high-costs/#63a81fa47854">well-funded</a> company, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/18/hyperloop-one-has-settled-the-lawsuit-with-former-co-founder-brogan-bambrogan/">settled a lawsuit</a> with one of its cofounders and several former employees, is currently engaged in numerous <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hyperloop-one-feasibility-study-dubai-roads-and-transport-authority-2016-11">feasibility</a> studies.)</p>
<p>8VC’s mission also underscores what Lonsdale most wants to focus on — the future.</p>
