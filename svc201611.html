<h2 align="left">This 18-year-old just raised $3.5 million to help developers easily add capabilities to their apps</h2>
<p><a href="https://rapidapi.com/">RapidAPI</a>, a two-year-old, San Francisco-based startup that enables developers to find, test, and manage many of the APIs they want to integrate into their apps, has raised $3.5 million in seed funding. The round was led by Martin Casado at Andreessen Horowitz, with participation from FundersClub, SV Angel, Green Bay Advisors, and 500 Startups, whose accelerator program it recently passed through.</p>
<p>The company is interesting for numerous reasons — not least of them its founder, Iddo Gino, an 18-year-old who was a high school senior in Haifa, Israel last year when he was “discovered,” so to speak. It happened at a local hackathon, where Gino caught the attention of Dov Moran. The renowned Israeli angel investor provided Gino with some early mentorship, as well as $250,000 in seed money that Gino — who studied briefly at the public research institute Technion – used to move to the U.S. in January.</p>
<p>Of course, RapidAPI’s mission — to enable developers to access and easily use publicly available APIs in a way that allows them to seamlessly communicate — is obviously of great interest to investors, too.</p>
<p>Gino likens these functional “blocks” that can be woven together, to pieces of plumbing, explaining that, “Each company has its own language. So [a developer] tries to learn how Facebook speaks then uses a dictionary to translate it back to English. And [he or she] has to do this every time” with every company and sometimes even across one company’s different divisions. RapidAPI has meanwhile created what are essentially big repositories of translator units, “so we don’t need an API company to change anything. We take care of turning everything into a single language.”</p>

<h2 align="left">Seen Enough? Here&#8217;s How to Get the SEC&#8217;s Attention</h2>
<p>Sean McKessy spent most of the last five years as first chief of the SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/">Office of the Whistleblower</a>, building the division into an 18-person unit that has chased down hundreds of the roughly 14,000 tips it has received to date and paying out $132 million to tipsters in connection with successful Commission enforcement actions.</p>
<p>McKessy left the agency in late July to join the Washington office of the whistleblower law firm <a href="http://www.phillipsandcohen.com/">Phillips &amp; Cohen</a>. He was in San Francisco this week, however, and we sat down with him to discuss a range of things, including how often the agency hears from the startup world, whether the SEC is likely to pursue fewer cases in Silicon Valley under a Trump administration and, either way, how tipsters can get the agency’s attention most effectively.</p>
<p>More from that conversation follows, edited here for length.</p>
<p><strong>You were an SEC enforcement attorney who left to work in the private sector, then came back to the SEC to spearhead this program. What was that like?</strong></p>
<p>It was a fascinating challenge. There was an awards program under the SEC that was specific to insider trading cases, but it had been around for [22] years and the entirety of the payouts was around $3 million. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act">Dodd-Frank</a> established the one that I ran, which was broader and basically said that if you come forward with any kind of securities law violation and help the SEC bring the case, you can get a reward.</p>
<p><strong>How big an award?</strong></p>
<p>The awards can range from 10 percent to 30 percent of the money collected when the monetary sanctions exceed $1 million.</p>
<p><strong>And the money comes from where?</strong></p>
<p>Wisely, Congress set up separate funds for whistleblowers to be paid out of. [So if you get an award], we’ll multiply the 10 to 30 percent against whatever was collected in the case you helped us bring, but the money is going to be paid out of a different pot. What Congress didn’t want was for victims’ rewards to be reduced because we’re [paying a] whistleblower.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the criteria, beyond that a case has to have sanctions of more than a million dollars?</strong></p>
<p>Well, for example, you need to have voluntarily provided information to us. If the SEC sends you a subpoena and that’s why you’re sharing information with us, you aren’t a whistleblower.</p>
<p>You also have to provide original information, though are exceptions; you can take publicly available information and synthesize it into analyses. The paradigm for that would be Harry Markopolos [the former securities industry exec who famously <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124208012">tried in vain</a> to warn the SEC about Bernie Madoff]. He never worked at Madoff; everything he knew was from public documents. But his analysis showed the only way Madoff could be producing the returns he claimed was through fraud. The program was set up [in the wake of that case] so people like Markopolos could be eligible.</p>
<p><strong>The office made a $20 million payout on Monday, but the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-237.html">release</a> about it is very opaque.</strong></p>
<p>The SEC is extraordinarily transparent about the cases it brings, so as soon as it brings an enforcement action, there’s a press release. But the whistleblower office has a statutory mandate not to identify whistleblowers. There are many pieces of information that the public would like to know that we thought could be reverse-engineered [to reveal a source].</p>
<p><strong>The office says 14,000 tips have come through the program since it went into effect in August 2011, and that it has paid out $132 million dollars to 34 people connected with 26 cases to date. Those don’t seem like great odds for potential whistleblowers.</strong></p>
<p>The number of people paid doesn’t necessarily represent everyone who brought good information; some have brought in good information where the sanctions have been less than $1 million. As I was leaving this summer, we had 800 ongoing investigations that were generated by whistleblowers. That’s actually a pretty high conversion rate. At any kind of intelligence or regulatory agency, you’re going to get 100 tips for every one or two that are good; that’s just the nature of the business.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think people are reaching out because of the money or they’re more interested in seeking justice?</strong></p>
<p>In the early days of the program, you weren’t even required to fill out a form, so anyone who supplied anything in writing had technically done what they needed to do, and in one case, we reached out a whistleblower and said, “You helped us bring a really good case; you provided information in writing. You could get paid.” The whistleblower said, “I didn’t do this to get paid; I’m not all that interested in it.” I [strongly encouraged him to accept the award] and he did.</p>
<p><strong>Donald Trump has pledged to dismantle the Dodd-Frank law. Are you worried about preserving what you built at the SEC?</strong></p>
<p>The speculation right now is the SEC’s whistleblower program will be spared because it’s working and it’s a fraud measure, and part of Trump’s philosophy is that we’ve got to “drain the swamp” and root out fraud wherever it may be. And for anyone looking to trim the government, I can’t think [doing away with the unit] is a compelling narrative. I think a lot of what drove people to vote in certain ways was this feeling that the game is rigged. So I don’t know how you tap into that [as a candidate], then turn around and say, “We’re going to take all the resources away from the agencies that we’re counting on to fix the system.”</p>
<p><strong>Are startup employees and investors aware of the whistleblower program and trying to take advantage of it?</strong></p>

<p>In her first public remarks since last week&#8217;s election, Federal Reserve chairwoman<strong> Janet Yellen </strong>just said the economy remains in good health for now, suggesting the central bank will go ahead and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/business/yellen-federal-reserve-congress.html?ref=dealbook">raise its benchmark interest rate</a> at its next meeting in December.</p>
<h2 align="left">YC Tries a New Experiment: Temporary Partners</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> has developed a reputation under its president, Sam Altman, for iterating — a lot. The accelerator program’s newest twist? Temporary or “visiting partners” who will be asked to become highly involved with a particular “batch” or YC class based on their particular expertise.</p>
<p>The partners will be a bit like YC’s “part-time partners,” a role the program created in 2011, except that part-time partners — who are invited to stay for six months — operate on renewable terms, and most tend to renew their position.</p>
<p>To kick off its newest initiative, YC is welcoming three of these visiting partners, two of whom are YC alums: Aaron Epstein, Gustaf Alströmer, and Lyle Fong.</p>
<p>Epstein founded Creative Market, a marketplace for digitally designed content that passed through YC in 2010. It was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/19/autodesk-buys-creative-market-jumping-into-maker-marketplace/">acquired</a> for undisclosed terms by Autodesk in 2014.</p>
<p>Alströmer is a product lead for growth at Airbnb. He previously worked as VP of growth at the communications app company <a href="http://www.voxer.com/">Voxer</a> and cofounded Heysan, a messaging service that graduated from YC in 2007 and was acquired for undisclosed terms by Good Technology in 2009.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Fong is the cofounder and CEO of mobile video game studio Hobo Labs. He also founded <a href="http://www.lithium.com/">Lithium Technologies</a>, a social media software company that’s best known in some circles for <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/03/26/klout-acquired-for-200-million-by-lithium-technologies/">acquiring</a> the social web startup Klout in 2014.</p>
<p>Before it kicks off its winter batch in January in Mountain View, Ca., YC is also bringing aboard three new “part-time partners” to add to more than the dozen of so already operating within the network.</p>

<h2 align="left">Zwift Raises $27 Million to Make Indoor Athletics More Social</h2>
<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://zwift.com/">Zwift</a>, founded two years ago in Long Beach, Ca., you aren’t alone. But investors have been following the company. Its massive, multiplayer video game technology, which caters to indoor cyclists, just attracted $27 million in Series A funding in a round that brings Zwift’s total funding to $45 million.</p>
<p>The round was led by the private equity firm Novator Partners out of London, with participation from Shasta Ventures, entrepreneur Max Levchin, and earlier backers, including the Swiss investment firm Waypoint and Samchully, a maker of bicycle parts that’s headquartered in Korea.</p>
<p>What are they tracking, exactly? Well, a 70-person company that’s been quietly establishing an avid following by merging gaming, indoor cycling and social elements and changing the way that people get fit during colder months and inclement weather.</p>
<p>Indeed, among Zwift’s appealing aspects is users’ ability to connect with friends and strangers around the globe for “virtual” group rides and races, which current users often log using the popular cycling and running app <a href="https://www.strava.com/">Strava</a>. That integration also enables users to see a map of the virtual path they’ve ridden, along with their incline stats and other performance information, like heart rate and cadence. And, like Strava, Zwift users can earn awards and badges — as when they zip through a sprint section the fastest.</p>
<p>Zwift doesn’t cost a fortune, either. In fact, a large part of its appeal is its affordability. It’s a little like a gamified <a href="https://www.pelotoncycle.com/">Peloton</a>, except that users needn’t buy a $2,000 stationary bike to get started. They can use the bikes they already own, along with their own trainers (which turn road bikes into stationary bikes). The cost? Just $10 per month, though it’s worth noting that users need to have “smart” trainers that can wirelessly interact with third-party software like Zwift’s. (These can run from $100 to $1,500.)</p>

					<p>Hi, all, hope you&#8217;re having a happy Tuesday.:)</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Mary Jo White</strong>, the head of the SEC, announced yesterday that she&#8217;ll <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2016/11/14/sec-chair-to-step-down-clearing-path-for-trump-to-eliminate-tough-wall-street-regulations/">step down</a> two years before the end of her term, clearing the way for Donald Trump to reshape the way Wall Street is regulated. What will that mean? Basically, the opposite of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/17/the-sec-gets-the-case-its-been-waiting-for-in-silicon-valley/">coming crackdown</a> on Silicon Valley startups that we&#8217;d foreseen last month. Now, the only thing stopping errant startups will be their investors &#8212; and we know how that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/the-truth-about-due-diligence/">usually goes</a>.</p>
<p>The <strong>FBI</strong> has reportedly signed a contract with <strong>Dataminr</strong>, a company that sifts through the Twitter newsfeed to identify issues and trends in real time. The Stack, which has the <a href="https://thestack.com/world/2016/11/15/fbi-signs-twitter-surveillance-contract">story here</a>, reports that only an estimated 1 percent of tweets are made available to the public through Twitter’s API, but using Dataminr,the FBI will now have access to all messages written on Twitter. (If you aren&#8217;t familiar with Dataminr, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/24/dataminr-ceo-on-whether-he-regrets-that-giant-fidelity-led-round/">talked</a> with CEO Ted Bailey earlier this year about his business.)</p>
<h2 align="left">Spark Capital just closed on $1 billion for the first time</h2>
<p><a href="http://sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>, whose investments have included Twitter and Cruise Automation, has closed on $1 billion in commitments, it <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/15/business/dealbook/venture-capital-firm-navigates-uncharted-course-to-success.html?_r=0">revealed yesterday</a>. The 11-year-old firm, which has offices in Boston, San Francisco, and New York, closed its fifth early-stage fund with $400 million, down slightly from the <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2013/02/26/spark-capital-closes-fourth-fund-at-450m/">$450 million</a> it had raised for its fourth-early stage fund, which closed in 2013.</p>
<p>Spark also garnered $600 million in commitments for its second growth fund, just two years after launching its debut growth fund with $375 million in capital. Like a lot of early-stage funds that have raised so-called opportunity funds in recent years, Spark uses the capital to invest in its breakout portfolio companies. Among the startups it has funded are the Brazilian real estate portal <a href="https://www.vivareal.com.br/">VivaReal</a> and the automated investing platform <a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/">Wealthfront</a>.</p>
<p>Spark has enjoyed a string of hits in its relatively short existence. Among its exits: headset maker Oculus was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/facebooks-acquisition-of-oculus-closes-now-official/">sold</a> to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014; Twitter went public in 2013; Wayfair, an online home furnishings company went public in 2014; and the autonomous driving tech startup Cruise Automation sold earlier this year to General Motors for a reported <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/11/gm-buying-self-driving-tech-startup-for-more-than-1-billion/">$1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The firm also holds stakes in the highly valued messaging service <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> and the still-private eyeglasses retailer <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/">Warby Parker</a>.</p>
<p>Spark is among a growing spate of early-stage venture funds that are suddenly managing far more money than they ever had previously. Other firms that have raised significantly higher amounts than in past years include Forerunner Ventures, a young, San Francisco-based firm that focuses primarily on e-commerce opportunities and has raised at least <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/06/forerunner-ventures-ups-the-ante-with-a-new-third-fund/">$122 million</a> this year, up from its last, $75 million fund; and decades-old Accel Partners, which closed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/venture-firm-accel-partners-just-raised-2-billion-from-its-investors/">$2 billion</a> across two new funds earlier this year, up from two funds that totaled $1.45 billion just three years earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Boldstart Ventures</strong> started off with $1 million in 2010 as a kind of experiment. Could a New York-based outfit find enough seed-stage, enterprise-focused, East Coast opportunities to rationalize a bigger fund? The answer, seemingly, is yes. Boldstart, founded by longtime VC <strong>Ed Sim</strong> (who’d spent the previous decade-plus an investor with Dawntreader Ventures), just closed its third fund with $47 million. That’s $30 million more than the $17 million Boldstart had raised for its second fund in 2013, says Sim, who now works alongside general partner <strong>Eliot Durbin</strong>. The two have also more recently brought in Work Market cofounder <strong>Jeff Leventhal</strong> as a venture partner. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/15/boldstart-ventures-locks-down-47-million-for-fund-three/">More here</a>.</p>

<h2 align="left">Noodling the Future of Urbanization</h2>
<p>For roughly a year, Niko Bonatsos, a managing director at the venture firm <a href="http://generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst Partners</a>, didn’t make a single investment. He was meeting with startups daily, as it’s his job to do. But Bonatsos, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R61vkrFkX5s">steered</a> General Catalyst to Snapchat in 2012, was finding it hard to be inspired by what he was saw.</p>
<p>That changed in September, says Bonatsos, who has spent recent months spending half his time focused on the question of what urban centers are going to look like in the coming decades. On a recent afternoon in San Francisco, we sat down with Bonatsos to talk about it. Our chat has been edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>You see a lot of space being freed up, or repurposed, thanks to companies like Uber, which may make parking structures redundant, and Airbnb, which is beginning to put two- and three-star hotels out of business. As an investor, where do you see the opportunities as this shift takes place?</strong></p>
<p>There are two buckets. The first is in helping cities to run more efficiently, and this is anything that’s happening in the background that you don’t notice until it breaks down – water management, parking, safety, energy stuff.</p>
<p>The second bucket is more consumer-facing, meaning products and services that make life better, easier, and more convenient for inhabitants of dense cites. Think of marketplaces to find roommates, or startups that can help you find physical storage, or hyper-local news that helps you understand what’s happening in the world around you.</p>
<p><strong>How long do you think the transition will take? And do you think the buildings will be the same as today or new?</strong></p>
<p>I think it will take ten to twenty years. And it feels to me that in the Western World, if you and I were to find ourselves in downtown San Francisco 30 years from now, most the buildings would be the same. I don’t see a lot of new inventory coming in. But buildings will need to be repurposed. [In addition to Uber and Airbnb], if Amazon continues to eat up [more of our discretionary spending], what’s going to happen to all the department stores? If self-driving happens, what does that mean for streets and parking lots?</p>
<p><strong>What <em>do</em> you think the implications of self-driving will be for city centers?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know if whether self-driving cars, when they happen 10 or 25 years down the road, will mean that cities will be more dense or not. You could argue it either way. The cost of transportation will go to zero, and it will be become either entertaining or productive for you to commute.</p>
<p>There may also be a consumer preference component, where the introverts are going to find themselves living in the suburbs, and the extroverts will be hanging out in downtown areas.</p>

<p>Alibaba says its Singles Day promotion yesterday smashed its previous sales record, and that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/11/alibaba-singles-day-2016/">recorded a stunning $15 billion</a> 20 hours into the event.</p>
<h2 align="left">Yep, 2016 Will See the Fewest IPOs since 2009</h2>
<p>While September might have been a good month for IPOs, things have slowed down considerably again, and don’t expect that to change before the first quarter of 2017. The last six weeks of the year are typically slow. There’s also the black swan outcome of the U.S. presidential election to factor into the picture.</p>
<p>What that means: 2016 will likely see as few IPOs as 2009 — there’s just too much ground to make up at this point.</p>
<p>New Pitchbook numbers underscore the point. In the first three quarters of this year, just $7.24 billion was raised across 49 public offerings — declines of 49 percent and 48 percent, respectively, over the first three quarters of 2015. And that’s taking both PE-backed and VC-backed companies into account. Breaking things down further, just $2 billion was raised across 31 venture-backed IPOs.</p>
<p>Also, the first time since 2008, not a single IPO raised more than $250 million for the issuer, notes Pitchbook. That largely owes to smaller floats. As IPO pro Lise Buyer noted when we chatted with her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/ipo-pro-lise-buyer-on-what-you-need-to-ipo-in-the-next-six-months/">last month</a>, it “used to be that you sold 10 to 20 percent of your shares in an IPO, but . . . valuations are low, so companies are smart to take advantage of the [demand created from] limited supply.”</p>
<p>As for so-called unicorns — of which there ostensibly remain roughly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/unicorn-leaderboard/">200</a> — just two made it out the door this year: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/nutanix-up-131-on-first-day-of-trading/">Nutanix </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/23/on-the-floor-of-the-new-york-stock-exchange-at-twilios-ipo/">Twilio</a>.</p>
<p>So what happens next? It’s hard to know. Most companies take advantage of the ability to file confidentially, which allows them to get the process started without alerting their competitors to their numbers. We may see a healthy number of offerings in the first quarter; we might not.</p>
<p>Of course, even those that may have been prepping public offerings could push them off for now while the markets adjust to the new U.S. president. As you might have noticed, while most of the market rose yesterday, tech stocks have been <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-10/tech-defanged-as-stocks-from-amazon-to-netflix-left-out-of-rally">crumbling</a> over apparent concerns about the impact the incoming administration will have on trade overseas.</p>

					<p>Hi, all, happy Thursday.:)</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>Why a Trump administration is expected to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/shelbycarpenter/2016/11/10/heres-what-trump-presidency-will-mean-net-neutrality/#27259a901b15">dismantle net neutrality</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/silicon-valley-is-worried-that-trump-is-going-to-g?utm_term=.glZe9W92gM#.bwooAEAV17">expand government surveillance</a>.</p>
<p>Here are numerous other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/09/trump-policies/">tech policies</a> that Trump promised to implement as president.</p>
<h2 align="left">Peter Thiel&#8217;s Big Gamble</h2>
<p>Peter Thiel should rightly be admired for sometimes seeing what many others cannot. He understood the power of <a href="http://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/e-commerce/history-of-paypal-1998-now-3630386/">online money transfers</a> well before most traditional financial institutions. He wrote Facebook a check when it was little more than an interesting startup from another Harvard dropout. Most recently, he anticipated what few of his peers predicted could possibly come to fruition: a Trump presidency.</p>
<p>Of course, Thiel more than recognized that Trump’s ascendancy was unstoppable. He spoke out publicly on Trump’s behalf, including in a keynote speech at the Republican National Conventional. He also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/technology/peter-thiel-donald-j-trump.html">donated</a> to Trump&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<p>If Trump retreated back to the world of reality television and his real estate dealings after this year’s election, as was widely expected to happen, Silicon Valley and the rest of the business world would eventually forget about Thiel’s ringing endorsement of Trump. As distance grew between Trump’s political aspirations and his ability to initiate global annihilation, the tech community would have been increasingly willing to forgive and forget.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump is now President-elect of the United States of America. And no matter what your position on that outcome – whether you consider him a genius for acknowledging an angry republic and for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/its-not-chaos-its-trumps-campaign-strategy/2015/12/09/9005a5be-9d68-11e5-8728-1af6af208198_story.html">cutting his way</a> to the most powerful office in the world virtually single-handedly, or you deem him a shallow narcissist who has repeatedly <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-american-tragedy-donald-trump">displayed contempt</a> for for women, minorities, civility, and critical thinking &#8212; he is wholly inexperienced as a politician. Things will be said that can&#8217;t be unsaid. Mistakes will be made. They will also serve as a persistent reminder of Thiel&#8217;s support for Trump.</p>

					<p>Hi, everyone. We know you don&#8217;t open StrictlyVC for our political opinion. We&#8217;ll just say that we&#8217;re stunned like so many others by what happened last night; like a lot of you, we&#8217;re still processing it all. (We&#8217;ve spent much of the day watching CNN for the first time since this country&#8217;s last election.)</p>
<p>As Hillary Clinton suggested in a concession speech a little earlier today, let&#8217;s all of us hope that Donald Trump will be a successful president for all Americans. Forward we go into the great unknown.</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>Silicon Valley reacts to Trump&#8217;s win with disbelief, outrage, fear and . . . <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-tech-reaction-20161108-htmlstory.html">a secession plan</a>?</p>
<h2 align="left">&#8220;He&#8217;s a Startup That Disrupted the Establishment&#8221;</h2>
<p>Fabrice Grinda, a longtime New Yorker, has helped create hundreds of jobs for Americans and others. Among the companies he has started is <a href="http://www.olx.com/">OLX</a>, one of the largest free classifieds sites in the world — one that was acquired over time by the African conglomerate Naspers for $250 million.</p>
<p>Grinda more recently cofounded <a href="https://www.beepi.com/">Beepi</a>, the peer-to-peer used car marketplace based in California; <a href="http://rebagg.com/">Rebagg</a>, a New York-based platform that buys high-end luxury bags from their owners for cash; and <a href="https://www.instacarro.com/">InstaCarro</a>, a Sao Paulo, Brazil-based car-buying service that will buy individuals’ cars for cash in an hour’s time.</p>
<p>Grinda and longtime business partner, Jose Marin, also plug between $15 million and $20 million of their own capital into startups each year through their joint vehicle, <a href="http://www.fjlabs.com/">FJ Labs</a>.</p>
<p>But though he sounds it, Grinda isn’t American. He doesn’t have dual citizenship. He’s “pure French.” He just happened to head to Princeton at age 17, and he hasn’t much wanted to leave the East Coast since.</p>
<p>So what does this European make of a new U.S. president who has Silicon Valley on edge? Because he’s a global operator and because he doesn’t live in the Bay Area, we talked with Grinda earlier today about President-elect Trump and whether he’s concerned about what comes next.</p>
<p><strong>How did the U.S. election just change the picture?</strong></p>
<p>Public market investors, limited partners in venture funds and private equity firms — they don’t like uncertainty. What they don’t know is the actual set of policies coming down the line that could impact them going forward. What will be his tax policy? What will his administration regulate and deregulate? It’s not like [Trump’s team] came forward with a well-thought-out set of policy proposals. It was all kind of vacuous. So I think investors will be more cautious until they understand what a Trump presidency means.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think it could impact you personally?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t spend much time thinking about politics. I’m not sure it has a real impact on day-to-day life. It’s a large part of the reason I’m on the Internet. I like its deregulated, fast-moving nature.</p>
<p><strong>Yet there could easily be consequences. People worry, for example, that for the sake of creating more American jobs, Trump might somehow slow tech, including self-driving technologies.</strong></p>
<p>There’s no hard data regarding what is going to be done. My only concerns are around the uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong>What do you make of Trump, the candidate, and soon, the president?</strong></p>
<p>I dislike the guy. I dislike populism and most of the things he said and much of what he stands for. I’m pro immigration and probably more socially liberally than anyone I know. But look, he’s a startup who has disrupted the establishment. He used a lot of the same tactics that a startup would use to get free press, frankly. He created a story that was compelling enough that he garnered press all the time and so had much lower acquisition costs than the other candidates. Jeb Bush was paying something like $5,000 per voter in the GOP primaries, where Trump was paying about $300.</p>
<p>In startup terms, he had an effective distribution and a marketing strategy and messaging that people found compelling. I think he proved the adage that any press is good press. And the establishment only realized this was dangerous once it was too late.</p>
