<p>Sorry for neglecting to include a link yesterday so that you could finish reading our central piece (about a new service for founders called <a href="https://signal.nfx.com/">Signal</a>).

<p>We&#8217;ve been on the phone since elbowing our kids out the door this a.m. so no column today, but there&#8217;s a wealth of great stuff below worth checking out.</p>
<p>Before we go, one last mention that this week&#8217;s sponsor, the <a href="http://finlab.cfsinnovation.com/">Financial Solutions Lab</a> at the <strong>Center for Financial Services Innovation</strong>, is now accepting applications for its next class. Selected companies will receive $250,000, plus access to lots of fintech resources. If you&#8217;re a fintech innovator with a product or service that can help more Americans achieve financial health (or know someone who is), <a href="http://finlab.cfsinnovation.com/challenge-2017/">apply today</a>. Applications are due March 16.</p>

<p>Investor <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong> says that, okay, yes, he wishes he’d invested in Snapchat’s Series A round. But he tells USA Today he isn’t buying into its IPO. &#8220;When you look at Snapchat, it doesn&#8217;t have governance. It doesn&#8217;t have compounding growth in users but it has compounding growth in usage. As a risk manager, I can overlook governance if I have massively compounding users and usage. But if one of those things is not there, I am <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/02/17/chamath-palihapitiya-social-capital-interview/98003656/">not going to take the risk</a>.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A New Way for Founders to Connect with the Right VCs</h2>
<p>A young Silicon Valley venture firm is taking the wraps off a piece of software that it says makes it a cinch for founders to figure out which VCs are worth approaching, based on stage, sector, and a variety of other factors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="https://signal.nfx.com/">Signal</a>, and it&#8217;s the first project of NFX Guild Labs, an offshoot of the venture firm and invite-only accelerator program <a href="http://www.nfx.com/">NFX Guild</a>, which we&#8217;ve written about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/18/james-currier-and-stad-chudnovsky-takes-the-wraps-off-their-new-incubator-nfx-guild/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Serial entrepreneur James Currier &#8212; who cofounded NFX with longtime business partners Gigi Levy Weiss and Stan Chudnovsky (who&#8217;s also the head of product at Facebook Messenger) &#8212; says that like so many innovations, Signal comes from a problem he found himself struggling to address.</p>
<p>Though part of NFX Guild&#8217;s promise to founders is to help them navigate the fundraising process, he says there was &#8220;no place for us to get an easy, clean list of active investors, where we could choose our target investors, then export that into a Google Doc or whatever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Signal is focused foremost on founders, but it should prove useful for VCs, too, says Currier. He uses travel startups as a theoretical example. &#8220;For [the early-stage venture firm] <a href="https://www.felicis.com/">Felicis</a>, a related intro is [a waste of everyone&#8217;s time]. Felicis doesn&#8217;t invest in travel, but no one knows that and there&#8217;s no easy way for Felicis to signal that to everyone. Or,&#8221; adds Currier, &#8220;say you&#8217;re an investor and you haven&#8217;t really spent time with blockchain startups. You won&#8217;t pop up on a founder&#8217;s radar as a result, but if you say on Signal that you&#8217;re starting to [poke around], you will.&#8221;</p>

<h2>In San Francisco, Lease Prices Hold Steady, But Landlords Offer More Perks</h2>
<p>Leasing commercial space in San Francisco is as expensive as ever, but prices are mostly holding steady for the first time in a long time &#8212;  not rising. That shift has landlords offering more perks and brokers wondering what&#8217;s next.</p>
<p>Their obvious concern: that good times can&#8217;t last forever, especially for venture-backed companies that aren&#8217;t IPO candidates and whose chances of getting acquired may be diminishing by the quarter.</p>
<p>Certainly, the cash isn&#8217;t flowing quite so freely at the moment. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/PitchBook/status/832621882864238592">Pitchbook</a>, investment in U.S.-based startups is right now down 40 percent year from the amount invested at this point last year.</p>

<p>&#8220;With some of the things that are being talked about on a federal policy level &#8212; reducing the corporate tax rate, repatriating cash at a lower tax rate &#8212; it looks like the [positive] economic cycle will continue for the tech industry,&#8221; says Colin Yasukochi, director of research and analysis at the commercial brokerage firm CBRE. &#8220;How long it will last is anyone&#8217;s guess, though,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;This expansion is definitely long in the tooth, for the U.S. and the Bay Area in particular,&#8221; says Robert Sammons, a director of research at the commercial real estate company Cushman &amp; Wakefield. &#8220;But I think we&#8217;re forecasting a slowdown, not a recession, and I think it’s just because it’s the cycle. It’s time. We need to reset the clock a bit.&#8221;</p>

<h2>How to Build a Brand in 2017: Tips from Glossier&#8217;s Emily Weiss</h2>
<p>There’s no shortage of women’s beauty brands, yet for many millennial women in particular, one young outfit — the cosmetics company <a href="http://glossier.com/">Glossier </a> — seems to stand out. Having products that customers like is undoubtedly one large reason why. The company’s “boy brow,” a kind of mascara meant to thicken and tame eyebrows, is particularly popular. But Glossier has also found a way to establish a kind of cult following because of the numerous ways it keeps communication channels to its consumers wide open.</p>
<p>At a <a href="https://strictlyvcinsiderseries6.splashthat.com/">StrictlyVC event</a> in San Francisco last week, Glossier’s founder, Emily Weiss, talked about focusing on ways to engage customers that more traditional brands have neglected. Weiss, a former beauty editor who launched Glossier several years after creating Into the Gloss — a site about women’s grooming routines that now attracts 1.5 million unique visitors monthly — also talked about the role of content in growing her business.</p>
<p>You can catch part of that talk by clicking through to TechCrunch below. Her interviewer is venture capitalist Eric Liaw of IVP, which recently wrote led Glossier’s $24 million Series B round. In the meantime, here are some other interesting — and instructive — outtakes from that conversation.</p>
<p><strong>On why Weiss launched Glossier in 2013, after creating Into the Gloss out of her apartment in 2010:</strong></p>
<p>Here, Weiss talked about the many influential people she’d come to interview for Into the Gloss, including J.Crew’s creative director Jenna Lyons, serial entrepreneur Arianna Huffington, and professional celebrity Kim Kardashian. “I’d be sitting on their bathroom floors and squeezing tubes of creams and … discussing the big wide world of beauty, and I realized there was a disconnect” between the leading beauty conglomerates and their customers, said Weiss. Though many women seemed to have an affinity for certain products, they didn’t necessarily know anything about those brands’ values or communicate with them in any way. Weiss spied an opportunity to rectify that by “building a company around what women want, not just from a product perspective but from an engagement perspective, from a distribution perspective, and from a values perspective.”</p>
<p><strong>Could she have built Glossier if Into the Gloss hadn’t attracted a following first? Could she have launched the two in reverse order?</strong></p>
<p>As a “content-first” company, it’s a question that Weiss receives a lot, evidently. But she doesn’t see the two businesses — the blog and the cosmetics line — as distinct. “Sure,” she’d said, “we could be a like a lot of consumer brands that start blogs after they start their business. But in our case, I think Glossier is still very much a content company. I think about our products themselves as pieces of content.” How, exactly? Because many of its customers purchase its products, photograph them, then upload them to social media — often knowing Glossier will re-post them to its own accounts. In fact, she likened Glossier’s products to “crayons” for its customers.</p>
<p><strong>On how the brand has stayed &#8220;authentic&#8221; versus become seen as more commercial:</strong></p>
<p>Weiss noted that in 2017, not only is the customer always right, but thanks to social media — whether it’s a product review on Amazon or an Instagram post, that customer “has a microphone and she’s reaching 50, 500, 5,000 or 500,000 of her nearest and dearest friends and is able to talk about her preferences.”</p>
<p>To ensure she is saying only positive things about Glossier, the company focuses, of course, on maintaining product quality. “Ultimately we’re making and selling a consumer good that needs to work and that need to make customers happy.”</p>
<p>But the company is also very focused on transparency and “voice,” Weiss explained. “We like to think that whenever we talk to [our customer] through captions on Instagram or through email or through copy on the site, that we’re writing text messages to a friend.” For Glossier, “staying true to that voice has created a lot of loyalty and trust with our customer,” she said.</p>
<p><strong>Other reasons that Glossier has struck a chord with its customer base:</strong></p>
<p>One point we found particularly interesting during Weiss’s talk was about Glossier’s willingness to acknowledge and support other brands.</p>

<h2>Top News in the A.M.</h2>
<p><strong>Snap</strong>, parent of messaging service Snapchat, has set the price range for its IPO and it&#8217;s seeking a a valuation of between $16.20 billion and $18.52 billion. That&#8217;s roughly 10 percent below expectations, which has industry observers wondering about its motivations. Either way, it gives the company the richest valuation in a U.S. tech IPO since Alibaba (and, before that, Facebook). Reuters has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-ipo-valuation-idUSKBN15V0JK">more here</a>.</p>
<h2>Atomico Just Closed on $765 Million, Its Biggest Fund Yet</h2>
<p><a href="http://atomico.com/">Atomico</a> has closed its fourth fund with $765 million, making it one of Europe’s single largest venture capital funds.</p>
<p>The firm began raising the fund eleven months ago (we’d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/18/atomico-is-raising-a-750m-fourth-fund/">flagged it for you</a> after searching the SEC filings). And while it represents a sizable step up from Atomico’s third fund, which closed with <a href="http://www.strictlyvc.com/2013/11/09/atomico-raises-476-6-million-third-fund/">$476.6 million</a> in 2013, its pace of fundraising highlights a major difference between Europe and the U.S., where LPs often feel pressured into committing quickly to top funds.</p>
<p>Investors had plenty of reason to be excited about Atomico. Its current stakes include Finnish game maker <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rovio-strives-to-create-next-hit-beyond-angry-birds-1472827593">Rovio</a>, as well as the “unicorn” payments company <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2016/11/07/buy-now-pay-later/#477704416870">Klarna</a> and the travel site <a href="http://www.goeuro.com/">GoEuro</a>. It also saw huge wins when Climate Corp. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-02/monsanto-buys-climate-corporation-for-930-million-bringing-big-data-to-the-farm">sold</a> to Monsanto for roughly $1 billion in 2013 and again last year when early portfolio company Supercell sold a majority stake in its business to China’s Tencent for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-agrees-to-acquire-clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-1466493612">$8.6 billion</a>.</p>
<p>But general partner Mattias Ljungman notes that the U.S. has a “much longer tradition” of investing in venture capital firms. Meanwhile, institutions in Europe are “sort of now starting to look at it. If you compare it with private equity [where investors tend to buy and sell entire companies], that also took time in Europe.” He says. “But once investors started to understand it, the amount of capital they began deploying became significant and even <a href="http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/dig.v33.n1.1202">outpaced</a> what we saw in the U.S.”</p>
<p>Atomico thinks European venture capital could reach the same kind of breakout velocity at some point. In the meantime, the firm — originally founded by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennstrom — is now one of the best-funded firms in Europe, with its central office in London but people on the ground in Beijing, Tokyo, Sao Paulo, New York and Stockholm (where Ljungman happened to be when we spoke).</p>
<p>Atomico also now offers some of the most extensive services to its portfolio companies, it likes to note.</p>

<h2>More Capital for L.A., as Fika Ventures Closes Its Debut Fund</h2>
<p>Investors are seemingly growing more excited about L.A. by the day. The newest sign comes via a $40 million fund that L.A.-based <a href="http://fika.vc/">Fika Ventures</a> is announcing today.</p>
<p>That’s none too shabby for a venture firm that was founded just last year.</p>
<p>Fika was created by TX Zhuo, formerly a managing partner at <a href="http://karlinvc.com/">Karlin Ventures</a>, and Eva Ho, a former general partner and cofounder of San Francisco-based <a href="http://susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a> who decided not to participate in that firm’s second, $<a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/08/16/susa-ventures-closes-50-million-fund-to-back-more-seed-stage-startups/">50 million</a> seed-stage fund — a split that Ho characterizes as “highly amicable. I left because I wanted to focus more on L.A-based investments, as well as be part of a smaller partnership. (Ho had three other partners at Susa.)</p>
<p>The two met in 2011, when Zhuo left a job as an associate with a <a href="http://www.innovationendeavors.com/">Palo Alto outfit</a> and headed to L.A. to launch Karlin, which is an affiliate of a much larger investment firm called Karlin Asset Management. He and Ho wound up working on several local events together, as well as collaborating and co-leading several days; over time, they realized they had complementary networks and like investing in similar things.</p>
<p>Ho declines to take credit for any deals at Susa, saying it “applied a team-approach across all deals,” but she says she was involved in supporting companies that include <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a>, a startup currently building a network of top tier computer science education programs across the African continent (it has gone on to raise $41 million to date, including from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative); <a href="https://www.modsy.com/">Modsy</a>, a startup bringing virtual reality to home design (it has raised roughly $10 million, including from Norwest Venture Partners); and <a href="https://www.flexport.com/">Flexport</a>, a freight logistics company that wants to be the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-11/flexport-wants-to-be-uber-of-the-oceans">Uber of the oceans</a> and has so far raised at least $94 million toward that end.</p>
<p>Zhou’s most notable deals meanwhile include the interior design marketplace <a href="https://www.laurelandwolf.com/">Laurel &amp; Wolf</a> (it has raised more than $25 million, including from Benchmark) and <a href="https://www.policygenius.com/">PolicyGenius</a>, an online insurance platform that has raised roughly $21 million, including from  Revolution.</p>
<p>Zhou and Ho says the fund took about six months to raise, including from some funds of funds, family offices, VCs, CEOs and founders — including 15 from their past portfolios. They also attracted institutional investors Cross Creek Advisors and Knollwood Investment Advisory.</p>

<h2>This VC Firm Just Produced One of the First Detailed Equity Reports About Snap</h2>
<p>Many things that used to be true primarily of the public market now happen within the world of private company investing, including the participation of mutual fund investors.</p>
<p>Now, you can add equity research reports to that list.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.goodwatercap.com/">Goodwater Capital</a> — a two-year-old, consumer-tech-focused venture firm is today taking the wraps off a <a href="http://www.goodwatercap.com/thesis/understanding-snapchat/">detailed snapshot</a> of pre-IPO Snap, parent of the disappearing-message app Snapchat. In doing so, the San Mateo, Ca., firm hopes to differentiate itself from its venture peers while also seizing on an underserved opportunity: producing research that helps Wall Street understand tech companies — before their own banking analysts do the job.</p>
<p>It’s a role that has largely been left to the media, which has been dutifully poring over Snap’s roughly 200-page <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm">S-1</a> since it was made public on February 2. Many reporters have done an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-03/snap-s-concentrated-power-structure-takes-a-page-from-old-media">excellent</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-facebook-wall-street-sizes-up-snaps-ipo-1486920692">job</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snap-letter/">too</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it’s nice to be able to review slightly more comprehensive, particularly if you missed a lot of the coverage that emerged in the days after Snap’s S-1 was first spied in the SEC’s giant electronic filing bin. It’s particularly worth examining if you’re not a Snap aficionado and want to become one quickly, given that the company’s roadshow could reportedly begin this coming Friday.</p>
<p>Goodwater’s report was overseen by Eric Kim, a former investor with <a href="https://www.maverickcap.com/">Maverick Capital</a>, who launched the consumer-tech focused firm with his former Stanford MBA classmate (and former <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/">Kleiner Perkins</a> partner) Chi-Hua Chien in 2014.</p>
<p>Kim, who previously worked on numerous high-profile deals for Maverick like the the multi-platform texting app <a href="http://www.kakao.com/main">KakaoTalk</a> and the e-commerce platform <a href="http://www.coupang-usa.com/">Coupang</a>, clearly took the task seriously, too. In addition to its own analysis, Goodwater last month surveyed 2,076 participants who were evenly distributed across geography, age, and income, to produce some of its findings.</p>
<p>Says Kim of what motivated him, “I saw KakaoTalk evolve from a 15-person company into a very valuable public company and there was suddenly this huge gap to bridge, with Wall Street looking at very different metrics than we were accustomed to discussing. Our [Goodwater] report [on Snap] aims to provide a comprehensive picture of the company that both Silicon Valley and Wall Street can understand.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Kim says he doesn’t think people (i.e., reporters) are looking at the company in the same way that Wall Street is liable to evaluate it. For example, Kim notes that plenty of editorials have compared <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-03/snapchat-s-performance-doesn-t-match-ipo-hype">Snapchat with Instagram</a>, but he asserts that even more than Instagram owner Facebook, Snap is “trying to take on the entertainment world and replace TV.”</p>
<p>In other words, a better comparison for Snapchat are entertainment companies.</p>

<h2>Bradley Tusk on His Fast Rise in Silicon Valley</h2>
<p>Bradley Tusk has long been known in political circles. He was once deputy governor of Illinois, working for the now-incarcerated former governor Rod Blagojevich. He also worked for Michael Bloomberg during one of his tenures as mayor of New York City and in 2009 ran Bloomberg’s successful, third re-election campaign.</p>
<p>In fact, thanks to a generous bonus check from Bloomberg, Tusk was able to launch a <a href="http://tuskstrategies.com/">consultancy</a> in 2010 that helps Fortune 500 companies launch political-style campaigns to achieve a particular end. A year later, in another stroke of luck, Tusk became the first outside consultant to Uber and accepted his pay in equity. Since then, through a <a href="http://tuskventures.com/">separate outfit</a> that <em>only</em> accepts its payment in equity,  Tusk has become a go-to source both Silicon Valley VCs and startup founders needing help in persuading regulators to let them have their way. (Among its other 23 clients: <a href="https://www.eaze.com/">Eaze</a>, <a href="https://www.altschool.com/">AltSchool</a>, <a href="https://www.lemonade.com/">Lemonade</a>, and <a href="https://www.handy.com/">Handy</a>.)</p>
<p>At a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145636603@N06/sets/72157676627652993/">StrictlyVC event</a> last week, Tusk talked about his work in Silicon Valley, whether he is interested (as sometimes rumored) in running for office himself, and what certain startups can expect from the Trump administration. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity; you can watch the broader interview if you click on the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Why go into business for yourself after the Bloomberg campaign?</strong></p>
<p>I knew that the skill set that I had was really devising and running campaigns, and because my work had taken me all over the country, I knew I could do it in lots of places. And those two things were a little different from what anyone else in that market was doing.</p>
<p>And Mike is a generous man, and he gave me a bonus at the end of the campaign, and I took a look at the amount left after taxes – it was all the money I had — and I looked at my wife and was like, “When this gets down to $50,000, I’ve got to go get a job.” And luckily it didn’t come to [that].</p>
<p><strong>What did you learn from Bloomberg that you’re replicating?</strong></p>
<p>The [most important] thing for Mike is his culture. So our business in some ways is a microcosm of Bloomberg, where we’re all in a bullpen and [operate in a] very flat hierarchy with total transparency and we try to treat people really well and pay them really well, and we assume that we’re going to get great talent and it’s going to pay off. If you look at almost all of his businesses, and as mayor, his real skill set is that he attracts [talented people], he knows how to recruit them, how to support them, and how to give them the confidence they need to take risks.</p>
<p><strong>There are <a href="http://www.globalstrategygroup.com/">other</a> political strategy firms working with tech companies, but Tusk Ventures is the only one that everyone knows of because you’re so high profile. Why not operate behind the scenes? </strong></p>
<p>[T]he deal flow is the lifeblood of any VC, and that’s true for us, too. And in some ways, because I didn’t come up through this world at all, there had to be a way to say “Hey, here’s who we are, here’s what we do. If you have a really interesting company with a really big problem, we’re willing to take it on and we’re willing to do it for equity and be part of your team.” But it took being out there enough for people to realize it.</p>
<p><strong>Are other political strategists starting to emulate your approach?</strong></p>
<p>I hope not. It’s a challenge in a sense that first, we’re able to do all of it for equity — though I pay my people in real dollars — so there’s a lot of financial risk that you have to be willing to take and I’m able to do that. Also, typically, if you’re someone like me and you’re five years into your political consulting firm, you sell it to one of these big holding companies like WPP or Omnicom. And they’d never let you do something like this. So I’d like to think there are some barriers to entry to replicating our model, but I’m sure someone else can come in and do it, too.</p>
<p><strong>Are you interested in running for public office?</strong></p>
<p>No, I mean, the only job to me that’s worth having is being mayor of New York City. It’s a great job. I did launch a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/encounter-bradley-tusk-de-blasio.html">super-PAC</a> about a year ago to get rid of our current mayor, Bill de Blasio, just because I think we deserve better than a mayor who’s under seven separate federal corruption investigations and who comes to work at 11 a.m and doesn’t work on Fridays and doesn’t care about substance. But that’s different than saying I want the job. Also, I’m an independent – another thing I got from Mike Bloomberg. And kind of like in San Francisco, in New York City, if you aren’t a Democrat, it’s exceptionally hard to win.</p>
<p><strong>Who would you get behind right now for president in 2020, including from the tech world?</strong></p>

<p>Starr VC<strong> Jim Goetz</strong>, who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/31/sequoia-capital-quietly-announcing-leadership-change-up-with-partner-jim-goetz-taking-a-step-back/">recently relinquished</a> his management responsibilities at Sequoia Capital, said at the time that he was going to &#8220;decamp&#8221; Sequoia&#8217;s Menlo Park office for a few months. Now, it looks like he may be spending that time in South Florida.
