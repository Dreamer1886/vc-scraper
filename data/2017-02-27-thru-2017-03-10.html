					<p>Friday!</p>
<p>We realize SVC is arriving comically late today. (We almost hate to send it and draw attention to this fact.) It&#8217;s been one of those days.:)</p>
<p>Hope you a great weekend, everyone. See you back here Monday.</p>
<h2>Top News in the P.M.</h2>
<p>Alphabet&#8221;s <strong>Waymo</strong> unit is seeking a preliminary injunction against Uber over self-driving car technology. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/waymo-files-for-an-injunction-against-ubers-use-of-its-self-driving-tech/">more here</a>.</p>
<p>The SEC has denied a bid to list a bitcoin-tied exchange-traded fund, citing the risk of fraud and a lack of regulation among the world’s bitcoin markets. As CoinDesk reports, the decision caps a <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/sec-shoots-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf-bid/">years-long quest</a> by bitcoin investors <strong>Cameron</strong> and <strong>Tyler Winklevoss</strong>, who first sought to list the ETF in mid-2013. The value of bitcoin has fallen 18 percent on the news, says Bloomberg.</p>
<h2>The Case for Tenured Voting</h2>
<p>It’s hard to get too worked up about unequal voting rights, which are seen by public market investors as giving founders too much control, while viewed by founders as necessary to protect their companies from short-term shareholders. The reality is that only a minority of companies can command these terms, most famously Google, Facebook, Zynga, Groupon and now Snap. The majority of other startups have far less leverage.</p>
<p>Still, the controversial structure seems to be growing more common. According to Dealogic, 27 of 174 U.S. IPOs in 2015 featured a dual-class structure. In 2014, 36 IPOs used the structure out of a total of 292 U.S. IPOs.</p>
<p>Why it matters: Research published last year by Institutional Shareholder Services suggests that companies with unequal voting rights <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/companies-with-unequal-voting-rights-underperform-shareholder-friendly-ones-study-finds-2016-03-31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">underperform</a> non-controlled companies over a one-year, five-year and 10-year period. Now Snap has taken the structure to an unprecedented extreme, even writing in its IPO paperwork that, “to our knowledge, no other company has completed an initial public offering of non-voting stock on a U.S. stock exchange.”</p>
<p>It’s too soon to know how Snap will fare. While its shares soared 44 percent on the day of its IPO last Thursday, they’ve since fallen about 16 percent, helped along by a growing chorus of skeptical analysts. The trend has some worried, though, including SEC Commissioner Kara Stein, who <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-rights-idUSL2N1GM0ZQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly raised questions</a> yesterday about the rights of investors, and who suggested the SEC “focus on how some innovations may prove detrimental to investors.”</p>
<p>One alternative the SEC might discuss is tenured voting, a structure that was lightly used decades ago, halted by regulators in the 1980s, and of growing interest again to a small number of Silicon Valley denizens who argue it’s a lot better than what tech companies have come up with.</p>
<p>It works much like you’d guess based on the word “tenure.” The longer an investor hangs on to his or her shares, the more voting control he or she amasses. The idea is to protect founders from activist investors, while also giving public market shareholders some say.</p>
<p>It’s immediately easy to see the appeal. Carl Bass long served as Autodesk’s CEO and had to wrestle with activist investors last year. Somewhat unsurprisingly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/10/carl-bass-on-his-surprising-autodesk-exit-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told us recently </a>that he’d “like to see tenured voting, where there’s a premium based on how long you own the shares.” It makes sense to Bass that “one person who has owned a million shares for one year has less voting power than another person who has owned a million shares for two years.”</p>
<p>Managing partner Scott Kupor of Andreessen Horowitz is also a fan of the idea, saying that as “part of broader capital markets reform to better align the long-term interests of shareholders and management teams, tenure-based voting would be far more amenable as a solution than the more blunt-force application of dual stock.”</p>
<p>The challenge, says Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law, is that “it takes time and you need a first mover.”</p>

<h2>A New, Affordable Naming Startup for Startups</h2>
<p>A few years ago, I launched a daily email <a href="https://www.strictlyvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">newsletter</a>, and I was ecstatic to be striking out on my own for the first time. Alas, just a few weeks after filing to secure a trademark, an officious-sounding note appeared in my inbox, and soon after, I found myself shelling out $10,000 in lawyer’s fees over a short-lived trademark dispute. It wasn’t nearly as painful as it might have been, but it was a rude realization that figuring out the right brand can be both time-consuming and have implications that founders might not foresee.</p>
<p>Of course, my experience is hardly rare. Most founders are typically left to either conduct trademark searches on their own via the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USPTO site</a>, or else pay top dollar for law firms or branding agencies to do it for them. Often they do both.</p>
<p>Thankfully, affordably eliminating risky name choices is exactly the opportunity that a two-year-old Bay Area company, <a href="https://www.namingmatters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naming Matters</a>, is chasing, and the company’s founder is very familiar with the market. S.B. Master previously co-founded <a href="http://www.naming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Master-McNeil</a>, a 29-year-old corporate naming and branding firm in Berkeley, Ca., whose past clients include Apple, General Motors, Disney and PayPal.</p>
<p>Now Master sees an opportunity to cater not just to deep-pocketed corporate customers but also startups on shoestring budgets. Indeed, 18 months ago, she decided to take everything she has learned over the years about linguistic analysis, trademark searching and domain name acquisition and pour it into a self-service software product that also incorporates search and data visualization. I talked with her earlier today to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve already run a naming company for decades. Why start this new thing?</strong></p>
<p>SM: Naming is hard, and we tend to work with companies that can afford us to do deep preliminary availability screening. I grew frustrated with how slow and antiquated that searching step is [for companies that can’t afford such a service]. I mean, if you have 100 names, how do you figure out which are most likely to get you into trouble, and which are your stronger candidates that you should focus on? There are legacy providers, but their model is to charge users for every name they look up. If you’re looking for a name in every country and every class, it adds up. You have to be very skilled to [keep your costs down].</p>

<h2>Top News in the A.M.</h2>
<p>According to the Financial Times, Japan’s <strong>SoftBank</strong> is selling an $8 billion stake in <strong>ARM</strong> &#8212; or 25 percent of the the U.K.-based chip designer that it purchased only six months ago &#8212; to its new $100 billion Vision Fund. (Put another way, Vision Fund is buying the stake.) According to Bloomberg, the transaction will <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/softbank-said-to-sell-25-percent-stake-in-arm-to-vision-fund">be separate</a> from the $25 billion that SoftBank plans to contribute separately to the fund.

<h2>Lemnos Lands $50 Million for Fund Three</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.lemnoslabs.com/">Lemnos</a>, a seed-stage, hardware-focused venture firm in San Francisco, is today announcing the close of its third and newest fund, with $50 million in commitments.</p>
<p>It’s a proud moment for cofounder Jeremy Conrad, whose pitch for Lemnos wasn’t met with a lot of enthusiasm when the firm was founded in 2011 but whose passion for hardware now resonates with plenty of investors.</p>
<p>Successful outcomes for hardware companies like Fitbit, Square, Oculus, and GoPro have helped, despite rocky moments for each. But perhaps even more appealing to investors are two tweaks that Lemnos is making to its model. For one thing, the firm, which has been running an incubator program since the outset, is dropping that operation to focus exclusively on operating as a venture firm. “We felt that as a bigger firm, when you’re writing bigger checks, it’s a different model,” says Conrad. (Lemnos closed its second fund with $20 million in 2014.)</p>
<p>The outfit is also expanding its mandate to invest in both startups with a hardware component and software companies that are developing a particular technology that will be used in a hardware device. Think a computer vision software startup looking to sell to robotics companies.</p>
<p>As for check sizes, those will be changing, too, as you might imagine. Whereas the firm began writing $50,000 to $100,000 checks to startups back in 2011, it might now start off with a check that’s $100,000, but it has money to invest up to $1.5 million in a $3 million round.</p>
<p>To date, Lemnos — operated by Conrad, cofounder Helen Zelman, and partner Eric Klein — has invested in roughly 40 companies.</p>
<p>It has just two small exits under its belt so far: the fleet management startup Local Motion, which sold to Zipcar for undisclosed terms in 2015; and Sproutling, maker of a smart monitor for babies, which was acquired by Mattel last year, again for undisclosed terms.</p>
<p>Still, Lemnos has stakes in a number of companies worth watching.</p>

<h2>Top News in the A.M.</h2>
<p><strong>Snap</strong>&#8216;s IPO shares soared a little <em>too</em> high yesterday for some brokerage firms. Two downgraded the stock yesterday and a third, London-based Atlantic Equities, downgraded the company today, warning that its <a href="http://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/45727/Snap-pops-44-as-IPO-investors-embrace-growth">valuation</a> may be &#8220;unsustainable.&#8221; Wrote an equity analyst in his research note: &#8220;At current levels, the stock is trading at a premium to Facebook after normalizing for engagement levels.

<h2>NexGen Venture Partners Just Raised $22 Million &#8212; from 83 Investors</h2>
<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://nextgenvp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NextGen Venture Partners</a>,  a young, Washington, D.C.-based venture firm that’s quarterbacked by a handful of investors but fueled financially by a network of hundreds of part-time investors who help with its portfolio, has raised $22 million for its debut fund. (This if you don’t count a <a href="http://dcinno.streetwise.co/2016/02/19/dc-tech-nextgen-venture-partners-expansion-plan-new-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$1 million</a> pool of capital that it raised from its network in 2015.)</p>
<p>We had a quick chat with Jon Bassett, one of the firm’s five partners, late last week to talk about what NextGen is trying to create. That conversation has been edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>NextGen evolved from a group of angel investors, correct? Was this a formal investor group that’s just been renamed?</strong></p>
<p>We began as a group of young entrepreneurs based in Washington who agreed to support our companies regardless of whether we personally invested. Over time, we had friends in New York City who wanted to expand this idea, and from there NextGen began to take shape. Now, it’s a rapidly growing group of over 650 people who continue to give us an edge in sourcing, diligence, and portfolio support.</p>
<p><strong>Did all of them contribute to this new $22 million fund?</strong></p>
<p>We have 83 LPs in our fund. A large number of them are also our venture partners who invested relatively small dollars. Our anchor LP is Brown Advisory, a $60 billion asset management firm that spun out of the former investment bank Alex. Brown. We also have high-net-worth investors from Dell, Carlyle, and T Rowe Price.</p>
<p><strong>Eighty-three LPs is a lot of LPs to manage. Do you think in the future that you’re likely to seek out bigger checks from fewer investors?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to raise larger dedicated funds over time with bigger check writers, but it’s important we maintain what makes our model so unique. Our strength in deal flow and portfolio support comes from our venture partners. Also, we [do and will] continue to create SPVs where our venture partners have the opportunity to invest alongside our funds.</p>
<p><strong>Do investors in your network get any special rights or privileges if they more actively help your portfolio companies than other investors in the network?</strong></p>

And here&#8217;s a reminder that shareholders get <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/02/investing/snapchat-ipo-no-votes/">no say</a> in how the company is run.</p>
<h2>Millennial Lender Upstart Just Raised $32.5 Million; Here&#8217;s Why</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.upstart.com/">Upstart</a>, a nearly five-year-old online lending company that prides itself on quickly identifying people who are less likely to default on money leant them, has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/upstart#/entity">$32.5 million</a> in fresh funding that brings its total funding to date to around $85 million. Partly, the company plans to use the capital to further fuel its current growth trajectory. In fact, according to CEO (and former president of Google Enterprise) Dave Girouard, Upstart expects to turn profitable this year.</p>
<p>But the company also sees a huge opportunity in licensing its technology to banks, credit unions, and even retailers that are eager to make low-risk — and profitable — loans to to their own customers.</p>
<p>Rakuten is certainly buying into its vision. The Japan-based internet services giant just co-led Upstart’s newest round with an undisclosed U.S.-based asset manager. Earlier backers Third Point Ventures, Khosla Ventures, and First Round Capital also joined the financing.</p>
<p>We talked yesterday to Girouard to learn more about Upstart’s new software-as-a service offering, online lending’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/for-online-lenders-its-suddenly-touch-and-go-2/">perception problem</a>, and how the Trump administration is likely to impact his 100-person company. Our chat has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Congrats on the funding. Is Upstart turning into a SaaS company?</strong></p>
<p>No, we still have and continue to grow our direct lending business. It’s how we learn and grow.  This [SaaS arm] will grow alongside it.</p>
<p><strong>What’s its “value proposition” to potential customers?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very similar in nature to any SaaS business; it’s the whole idea of people saying, “We’re not going to try to build something ourselves.” We’re strongly on the tech and data science end of the spectrum. We don’t come from financial services, as do a lot of other [lending] companies. We apply very modern data science to the question of who gets a loan and at what price; that’s the heart of what we’re known for.</p>
<p><strong>You’re targeting existing lenders, as well as hoping to help retailers and others get into the lending business. Is that right? And what you will be charging them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and we’ll charge a monthly fee, then a smaller fee per loan that captures the cost of originating a particular loan.</p>
<p><strong>You started your direct lending business by targeting millennials. Is that still your target market?</strong></p>
<p>It’s still our sweet spot, young adults. Our average borrower is 28. The most common use of [our loans] is to pay credit card debt, though it’s really a personal loan that you can use for anything.</p>
<p><strong>How do you market to this demographic?</strong></p>
<p>Our approach is predominately digital. Our borrow is typically online, so [we advertise on] Facebook and Google; we have high marks on the [personal finance platform] Credit Karma. We still do some some offline direct mail; our industry is dominated by it. But we don’t do nearly as much as others.</p>
<p><strong>What are your default rates? Do you share those publicly?</strong></p>

<h2>In Uber Video, CEO Speaks Openly About Impact of Competitors</h2>
<p>A newly published video clip of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick may offer the world’s first glimpse into his thinking about businesses that compete with his ride-sharing juggernaut.</p>
<p>The clip — filmed earlier this month while Kalanick was using Uber’s Black car service and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/in-video-uber-ceo-argues-with-driver-over-falling-fares">provided to Bloomberg</a> yesterday afternoon by the driver, Fawzi Kamel — mostly shows Kalanick bantering with the two women between whom he is sitting.</p>
<p>Once Kalanick prepares to exit the car, he shakes Kamel’s hand and engages in a conversation that he presumably thinks will be friendly but quickly sours. In that interaction, Kalanick explains why Uber’s rates have fallen so dramatically, pointing to competition that has made price drops inescapable. Meanwhile, Kamel argues with Kalanick, telling him he could have kept prices higher and that Kalanick’s decision not to do so has “bankrupted” him.</p>
<p>The conversation ends when Uber tells Kamel to take responsibility for his own decisions.</p>
<p>Kalanick has since apologized to his employees for his tone in speaking with Kamel. In an email to them last night, he wrote:</p>
<p><em>By now I’m sure you’ve seen the video where I treated an Uber driver disrespectfully. To say that I am ashamed is an extreme understatement. My job as your leader is to lead … and that starts with behaving in a way that makes us all proud. That is not what I did, and it cannot be explained away.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s clear this video is a reflection of me—and the criticism we’ve received is a stark reminder that I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up. This is the first time I’ve been willing to admit that I need leadership help and I intend to get it.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to profoundly apologize to Fawzi, as well as the driver and rider community, and to the Uber team.</em></p>
<p>You can check out the full clip to see what transpires, and why Kalanick might have been caught off guard.</p>

<h2>Kabam&#8217;s Roller Coaster Ride to an $800 Million Sale</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Developers Conference</a> kicked off in downtown San Francisco yesterday, and consolidation is a central theme for this year’s attendees.</p>
<p>Late last week, we talked with Kevin Chou, co-founder and CEO of the gaming company <a href="https://www.kabam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kabam</a>, about his own both stressful and euphoric experience in running a gaming startup for roughly a decade before <a href="http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/kabam-netmarble-acquisition-marvel-contest-of-champions-1201945372/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">selling </a>most of its assets in December to South Korea’s Netmarble Games for a reported $700 million to $800 million.</p>
<p>His earliest investor, Maha Ibrahim of Canaan Partners, joined the conversation to share her perspective on the company’s highs, lows and in-between moments, too. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin, you spent a little time working for Maha as a junior investor at Canaan before founding Kabam. In fact, Kabam was incubated at Canaan’s offices. At what point did you know you wanted to create a gaming company?</strong></p>
<p>KC: I was definitely excited about what was happening with the consumer internet. This was in 2006, when Facebook was still mostly focused on college students. I wanted to start a social network for young professionals, but after some twists and turns, it became a gaming company.</p>
<p>MI: Kevin and his three co-founders were trying to build a better LinkedIn, but we found out with the seed money that we gave the company that it wasn’t working. I told him he could either give back the $250,000 we’d given him or find something else to do with it. So that first pivot was called <a href="https://itvt.com/node/10752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watercooler</a>. It was a social network for sports and TV and movie fans.</p>
<p>KC: It grew on the back of Facebook. At its peak, it was getting 2 billion page views per month, but we couldn’t monetize it at all. So we dabbled a bit more in fantasy sports.</p>
<p>MI: I’d given the company a Series A at that point, and there was this moment at this café in Mountain View where Kevin was totally stressed out. He’d taken up smoking again because he couldn’t figure out how to make money off [Watercooler]. So it was around this time — right, Kevin? — that he pivoted into becoming a Facebook game provider, with <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/kingdomsofcamelot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kingdoms of Camelot</a>, which became a massive hit.</p>
<p><strong>So two pivots so far.</strong></p>
<p>KC: At first, Facebook said [to game developers], “You’ll keep all the revenue, but we own the real estate around the frame,” so the economics were built on that type of relationship. Then, [in a later, somewhat infamous development] Facebook said we’re going to take 30 percent of everyone’s revenue. To be fair, Apple and other [platform companies] were also taking a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/24/facebook-revenue-share-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">30 percent revenue share</a>, but the way that Facebook had tried to build out platform — the way they used real estate — made it very difficult to operate a full-fledged game. You couldn’t control the entire experience. And then with that 30 percent tax, it became a very different business for us. We went from being very profitable to very <em>not </em>profitable overnight.</p>

<h2>Softbank is in Talks to Invest Up to $4 Billion in WeWork</h2>
<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank is being linked with an investment that could value WeWork at more than $20 billion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/26/softbank-set-to-invest-more-than-3-billion-in-wework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC reported</a> that the Japanese telco giant is gearing up to make an initial investment of $2 billion into WeWork, with a view to putting nearly $1 billion more into the firm. The publication said the secondary investment could reach $2 billion, which would put SoftBank’s total input at $4 billion overall.</p>
<p>WeWork declined to comment on the report.</p>
<p>So far, the seven-year-old company has raised $1.4 billion from investors.</p>
<p>A source familiar with the situation confirmed that WeWork is in talks with SoftBank over an investment per the report. However, the person added that the Japanese had also held discussions with a view to participating in its $150 million Series C (2013) and $355 million Series D (2014) rounds, deals that SoftBank ultimately did not join.</p>
<p>One gating factor this time around centers on SoftBank’s Vision fund, which is still seeking commitments from investors, and in particular prospective LPs in the Middle East, our source added.</p>

<p><strong>Bloq</strong>, a 1.5-year-old, Chicago-based company whose software aims to allow companies to build, manage and scale blockchain-enabled ecosystems, has acquired a blockchain analytics company called <strong>Skry</strong> &#8212; formerly Coinalytics &#8212; for undisclosed terms. It&#8217;s the first acquisition for Bloq, which hasn&#8217;t disclosed outside funding. <a href="http://bloq.com/">More here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HomeHero</strong>, a three-year-old, Santa Monica., Ca.-based platform connecting in-home caregivers with clients, has shut down. The company had raised $23 million from investors, including <strong>Graham Holdings Company</strong>, <strong>Social Capital</strong>, <strong>Tencent Holdings</strong>, the <strong>Launch Fund</strong>, and <strong>Science Inc</strong>.  Cofounder and CEO <strong>Kyle Hill</strong> says that being forced to switch from a contractor model to paying staffers as W-2 employees killed the company. <a href="https://medium.com/@kaleazy/theres-no-magic-in-venture-backed-home-care-8f5389528279#.ei0v97rbw">More here</a>.</p>
<h2>People</h2>
<p>It pays to be an Apple board member. <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/02/24/apple-board-member-al-gore-sells-295m-of-company-stock">According to Apple Insider,</a> an SEC filing on Friday revealed that <strong>Al Gore</strong>, the former U.S. vice president and climate activist, sold about $30 million in Apple stock last week. Gore, who was appointed to the company&#8217;s board in 2003, still owns Apple shares worth $31.5 million, according to the outlet.</p>
<p>Perhaps an on-stage interviewer at the Mobile World Congress was off the grid last week, or perhaps <strong>Anthony Levandowski</strong>, who sold his company Otto to Uber last year, refused to appear if asked about a new lawsuit from Alphabet that accuses Otto of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/23/waymo-sues-uber-and-otto-for-theft-of-trade-secrets/">IP theft</a>. Either way, the allegations were very notably <em>not</em> addressed in a fireside chat earlier today, says TechCrunch. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/27/heres-what-the-head-of-ubers-self-driving-program-wasnt-asked-on-stage-today/">More here</a>.</p>
<p>According to four sources who spoke to the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/technology/snap-founders-evan-spiegel-bobby-murphy.html?ref=dealbook&amp;_r=0">last week</a>, the reason that Snap’s founders are denying shareholders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/business/dealbook/snap-ipo-plan-evan-spiegel.html">any say</a> in the running of their company can be traced to dissatisfaction with <strong>Jeremy Liew</strong>, a venture capitalist with Lightspeed Venture Partners who wrote Spiegel the company’s first check, for $485,000. Here&#8217;s why we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/25/snap-supporters-find-a-scapegoat-in-jeremy-liew/">don’t buy that argument</a>.</p>
<p>According to Fortune&#8217;s Erin Griffith, <strong>Brian Pham</strong>, a principal at Sherpa Capital since 2013, has left the firm to build his own startup in what he calls &#8220;consumable&#8221; AR. He tells Fortune he hasn&#8217;t raised any money yet.</p>
<p>Billionaire <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>&#8216;s &#8220;fingerprints are all over the administration,&#8221; reports Politico in a breakdown of where Thiel&#8217;s influence is <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/donald-trumps-shadow-president-in-silicon-valley-235372">most apparent</a>.</p>
