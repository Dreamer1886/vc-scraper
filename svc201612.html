<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>About ten hours after it began employing self-driving cars to pick up customers in San Francisco, <strong>Uber</strong> was yesterday ordered by state regulators to stop using the cars in California, at least until Uber secures the necessary permit issued by the state to allow companies to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/14/uber-ordered-to-stop-self-driving-vehicle-service-in-san-francisco/">More here</a>.</p>
<h2 align="left">What That New Fed Rate Increase Means for Venture-Backed Startups</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve yesterday raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent, up from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent. People in the business of venture-backed startups were paying attention, too, and not because of the new range, which is still super low by historical standards. It’s what the move augurs – even higher interest rates in 2017 – that interests them.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Well, if you’ve founded, or invest in, early-stage startups, it probably doesn’t – yet. Enough investment capital has been raised in the last 12 to 24 months to insulate young companies and early-stage investors for some time to come. “If you’re investing behind two women and a cat, it makes no matter what the Fed is doing,” says Venky Ganesan, a managing director at the early-stage venture firm Menlo Ventures.</p>
<p>“There’s still a lot of money in the system that needs to go somewhere,” adds Bradley Tusk, a political strategist and investor who notes that investors began bulking up on capital earlier this year, partly in anticipation of rising interest rates.</p>
<p>Still, for later-stage investors and companies, the story could prove starkly different.</p>
<p>In recent years, operating in a near zero interest rate environment, investors who might have otherwise parked their assets in bonds and other fixed income securities began looking elsewhere for returns. Startups within spitting distance of a public offering became a popular place to dump some of that money. “People forget how unusual that is,” says David Golden, a managing partner at Revolution Ventures who worked earlier in his career as a JPMorgan exec. “The fact that capital has been so cheap is partly what has fueled the sea change in early-stage valuations since the financial crisis. Cheap equity means that you can raise millions of dollars without having to give up very much of your company.”</p>
<p>As capital becomes more expensive, those “bargains are going to start to retreat.”</p>

					<p>Hi, everyone, happy Wednesday! (And thanks to those of you who wished us well on Monday. We&#8217;re happy to report that we&#8217;ve recovered from our plague of earlier this week.)</p>
<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>If you live in San Francisco and call up an <strong>Uber</strong> today, it might just be self-driving. It rolled out its new program <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-14/uber-rolls-out-self-driving-cars-in-san-francisco-without-dmv-approval">without DMV approval</a>, too. (You can find out why at <a href="https://strictlyvcinsiderseries6.splashthat.com/">our evening event</a> in SF in February, featuring <strong>Bradley Tusk</strong>, the regulatory strategist who has long counseled Uber on just how far it can push things. Roughly half the seats are now gone, but you still have time to nab yours.)</p>
<h2 align="left">Newer VC Firms Trounce Their Predecessors on Diversity Front</h2>
<p>Over the last three months, the venture firm <a href="http://www.socialcapital.com/">Social Capital</a> has worked with the media outlet <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/">The Information</a> to put together a look at the most diverse venture firms for the second year in a row. The teams say they gathered more than 6,000 data points about 580 senior investment professionals at the 72 most active U.S. venture firms to draw their conclusions</p>
<p>What they found, broadly speaking, was a tiny bit of change in the right direction. The number of women working as investors within venture firms increased 2.5 percent over last year. That sounds grim, but it turns out that women represented slightly more than 23 percent of all new investors at the venture firms studied.</p>
<p>As for the number of non-white senior investment professionals, that stat — which is 2.4 percent higher than it was a year ago — sounds grim and looks even worse on close inspection. Just one percent of senior VCs involved in investment decisions are black. And only 1.3 percent are Hispanic. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that the percentage didn’t slip backwards from last year</p>
<p>Those numbers didn’t surprise us. Nor did the study’s findings that 89 percent of investment decision-makers at the top 72 firms are (still) male and 75 percent are (still) white, even while those numbers are slightly improved from last year, when the numbers were 92 percent and 78 percent, respectively</p>
<p>What we found more striking is that among the top ten most diverse venture firms, nine have been founded in the last decade or so. That’s pretty significant to our mind</p>
<p>One could argue that younger venture firms are almost by definition smaller venture firms, meaning diversity can come a bit more easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://lowercasecapital.com/">Lowercase Capital</a>, for example, receives top billing as the most diverse venture firm in this study. But Lowercase has just three partners: Chris Sacca, who’s a white man, Matt Mazzeo, another white man, and Sacca’s wife, Crystal English Sacca, who’s both a woman and Asian. Because the Saccas are eight years older than Mazzeo — they are both 41 and he is 33 — Lowercase also scores much higher in terms of age diversity than many of the firms in the list, most of which have more than three partners.</p>
<p>One could further argue that to date, diversity hasn’t been necessary in producing strong returns. Union Square Ventures, which is managed by <a href="https://www.usv.com/about">five middle-aged white guys</a>, ranks dead last on this new list, and most investors would kill for its track record.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, past performance does not guarantee future results.</p>

<h2 align="left">At Founders Den, a Private Club Relying on the Powers of Persuasion</h2>
<p>If you live in San Francisco and know much about tech startups, you’ve likely heard of <a href="http://www.foundersden.com/">Founders Den</a>, a shared office space and private club for startups and investors that leases 85,000 square feet on a nondescript block in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Founders Den accommodates between 12 and 15 startups at a time, each of them with six or fewer employees. The startups must be invited into the fold, and they must agree to stay no longer than six months. They’re also asked to pay market rates for the space they occupy.</p>
<p>“It’s a terrible business,” jokes Jason Johnson, an entrepreneur who decided six years ago to establish Founders Den with three friends: Jonathan Abrams, Zack Bogue, and Michael Levit. The four work to break even each month, owing to additional office perks that they provide, like a full-time office manager. “If we wanted to make money on [the space], we’d lease it out to many more companies and charge a premium,” Johnson says. “But that isn’t of interest to any of the four of us.”</p>
<p>What is of interest is forming a “curated” community of founders who help one another and provide each other with investment opportunities, and on that front, Founders Den is proving very successful, especially for its creators.</p>
<p>Johnson says he has invested in several startups to get their start inside of Founders Den, including <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, the six-year-old company behind the Docker open source platform space (it has gone on to raise $180 million from investors), and the mobile app company SocialCam, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/17/socialcam-autodesk-60-million/">acquired</a> by Autodesk for $60 million in 2012.</p>
<p>A founder doesn’t have to make room for anyone at Founders Den on his or her cap table.</p>

<h2 align="left">Top News in the <strong>A.M.</strong></h2>
<p>The highly hyped demonstration videos of <strong>Magic Leap</strong>, the secretive augmented reality company, were actually created by a special effects studio, according to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/the-reality-behind-magic-leap">new piece</a> from The Information that spells out what a lot of industry insiders have long speculated: that the promises of the well-funded startup are far from being realized. Magic Leap&#8217;s company&#8217;s founder and CEO, <strong>Rony Abovitz</strong>, has <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/magic-leap-ceo-rony-abovitz-tweetstorm-response-to-information-report-2016-12">since tweeted</a> that &#8220;what&#8217;s coming next&#8221; from Magic Leap is &#8220;the best part.&#8221; (Natch.)</p>
<h2 align="left">Formation 8 Founder Jim Kim Has a New Fund in Builders</h2>
<p>Jim Kim, who most recently cofounded the venture firm Formation 8, is launching a brand-new venture firm called <a href="http://builders.vc/">Builders</a> that looks to be raising a $200 million fund, judging by a recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1689584/000168958416000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a>. His cofounder is Paul Lee, who left the Chicago venture firm Lightbank in 2014 and last year launched a startup studio called Roniin that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/08/roniin-a-newfangled-startup-factory-in-chicago-emerges-with-3-million-in-funding/">wrote about</a> last year.</p>
<p>It isn’t a surprise to see Kim starting something new. After a tumultuous 2015, Formation 8 had <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/11/05/venture-firm-formation-8-calls-it-quits/">decided against</a> raising a third fund.</p>
<p>We wondered whether Builders meant that Lee was similarly moving on from Roniin, however, so we recently caught up with both men to ask that question, as well as ask how they came together, and what Builders — which already has an office in both San Francisco and Chicago — plans to do differently than the hundreds of other venture firms up and running. (We also asked about the pair’s fundraising progress, but they declined to comment, citing SEC regulations.)</p>
<p>More from that conversation follows.</p>
<p><strong>How well do you two know each other? When did you meet?</strong></p>
<p>PL: We go back 15 years. We both started our careers at GE Capital. Jim was building up its IT practice; I was building up its media practice. But we spent time talking about deals, we’d get drinks. We’ve probably talked monthly ever since then.</p>
<p>We did go off and build our own platforms. Jim built Formation 8. I ran Lightbank. But he was my first call in helping shape Roniin and he was the first investor in the platform and in five of the companies that have come out of the platform since.</p>
<p><strong>Roniin’s big idea was to take the ideas of overly busy entrepreneurs, find first-time founders to bring them to life, then give both a big chunk of the new company — along with a little seed capital from Roniin. What happens to it now that you’re starting a new fund?</strong></p>
<p>PL: It’s being rebranded as Builder Studios, and it will be working with the startups that we fund. [The $3 million seed round it raised] was used to prove out the concept and it worked; we learned how to run that P&amp;L and run that infrastructure without a massive amount of burn. Now, we want to use that team of experts we’ve assembled [including engineers, sales personnel, marketers, and back office operations employees] to support our portfolio companies.</p>
<p><strong>So you’re creating more of a platform for your new fund. And will the people at the studio get equity in these startups? How does compensation work across the fund and the studio?</strong></p>
<p>JK: We aren’t commenting publicly on that right now. But when you look at the data, one out of every three seed-funded companies was able to raise a Series A round a few years ago; now, that percentage is much smaller. So there’s this opportunity to help an entrepreneur who has a good technical team to find product-market fit and help give them multiple shots on the goal. We aren’t talking about PR or HR. We think instead startups can benefit greatly from working alongside this studio and accessing this group of operators [to improve everything] from their UI/UX to product development.</p>
<p><strong>How much money will you be plugging into your portfolio companies?</strong></p>

<h2 align="left">Heavy-hitting KKR Just Raised a $711 Million Tech Growth Fund</h2>
<p>So much for non-traditional venture investors retrenching from the market.<br />
Yesterday, KKR the global investment firm, announced a $711 million close on its KKR Next Generation Technology Growth Fund, which it plans to use to back growth-stage companies in the technology, media and telco industries in North America, Europe and Israel.</p>
<p>It’s a new product for the firm, though you might have seen its name crop up in a good many deals this past year; that’s because it began investing it nearly year ago.</p>
<p>Among the bets it has made are the big data analytics company Optimal+ ; the tour-booking platform GetYourGuide; the cloud integration software company Jitterbit; and the cyber defense company Darktrace.</p>
<p>Including those bets and others made outside the fund, KKR says it has invested more than $640 million in still-private, growth-stage investments since 2014. Some of those other investments include stakes in the anti-virus software company Cylance; in the fantasy sports business FanDuel; and in the augmented reality company Magic Leap.</p>
<p>What’s KKR’s criteria, exactly, when looking at these deals? According to new-hire David Welsh, who joined the firm in October from Adam Street Partners to head up the new fund, TMT Growth will be focused on “private companies that are beyond early-stage technology risk but are still scaling their market-expansion efforts and are experiencing high growth. They have technology and go-to-market models that are proven but have lacked the capital and backing of an established partner or sponsor who can help catapult their growth and development.”</p>
<p>So what you’d guess, basically.</p>
<p>As for the checks the fund will be writing, Welsh says these will tend to be less than $100 million and that his 12-person team will generally be targeting investments of $40 million to $50 million per company.</p>
<p>Perhaps worth noting: The new fund doesn’t have any strict revenue thresholds, according to Welsh. In fact, it might invest in companies that still have operating losses. But it does “want to see a clear path toward profitability and evidence of a model that improves as revenue continues to scale,” he adds.</p>

<h2 align="left">Longtime VC Michael Goguen Slapped with an Even Stranger Lawsuit</h2>
<p>Michael Goguen — a longtime venture capitalist whose career at Sequoia Capital ended earlier this year after he was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/11/longtime-vc-michael-goguen-was-just-hit-with-an-explosive-lawsuit/">sued</a> in a salacious <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/304104968/Goguen-Baptiste-San-Mateo-Court">breach of contract</a> suit that accused him of sexually mistreating a woman named Amber Baptiste and then refusing to honor a financial arrangement they made afterward — has been hit with yet another strange lawsuit. But this one has a surprise twist</p>
<p>Filed Friday in San Mateo County Court, Goguen is this time being accused of breaching a contract with a former acquaintance named Bryan Nash, who says in his lawsuit that Goguen agreed to pay him a whopping $19 million for public relations and asset management services, then didn’t</p>
<p>Sounds strange, right? Keep reading.</p>
<p>According to Nash’s suit, he first met Goguen in 1994 and they became “friends.” As Nash and Goguen’s “friendship developed,” they enjoyed “joint family gatherings,” took “vacations together,” went “mountain biking together,” and also exercised together.</p>
<p>Fast forward to April of this year (and the suit basically does precisely that), and Nash “stated to [Goguen] that he was going to consult with an attorney to see what legal rights he had that would addressing the wrongs he felt had been done to him by Goguen.” (The suit does not outline these alleged wrongs.) It goes on to read that “Goguen stated that he did not think that was necessary, but rather they could just come to an agreement to address these wrongs, and other issues, and suggested that they work together</p>
<p>What the two settled on, says Nash, were “services” that Nash would provide for Goguen, including “unrelated professional and personal assistance to Goguen for the payment of $19 million</p>
<p>Goguen, according to the suit, then agreed to wire an initial payment of $15 million.” Yet “before the funds were deposited through the wire transfer, Goguen withheld, or revoked it,” it states</p>
<p>Now, Nash is suiting for “damages due to this breach” to the tune of $15 million.</p>
<p>If this lawsuit doesn’t seem to add up, it’s for good reason, say multiple sources.</p>
